2024-12-06 06:36:14,Best exchange for DCA BTC in UAE/Dubai and then to trezor - how to compare the best exchange cost wise?,"Hi,
I wanted to know which is the best platform cost wise for dca to btc and then eventually to trezor.

I would be planning to buy btc until it reaches 1k and then transfer to trezor. However I'm not sure which is the best exchange and how do I compare the costs associated with the exchanges and what to look out for?

I have seen okx, binance, bit oasis, etoro, p2p however from the pinned post I saw strike and rain is there but I don't know which one would be the cost effective one? As I would be using local currency of aed maybe there is forex charges also? so any guidance is appreciated.",1,0,muslim_marriage_acc,Bitcoin
2024-12-06 06:22:58,My experience with bitcoin,"So I'm like the least knowledgeable when it comes to investing. Sure I own a 401k and part of my paycheck goes into it automatically but that's it. I barley know investing terms. I don't buy stocks or do anything else with investing.

I dont like risking my own money, well in 2020 during covid I took a chance, well sort of. I took the entire stimulus check and put it into bitcoin when it was 8k. I thought why not, it's not really my money. Well turns out it was a great idea. I haven't sold and still own it. 

Why haven't I sold? I think part of it is I'm too lazy to transfer off my ledger and onto an exchange to sell, making it just much easier to keep hodling.

2024-12-06 05:47:58,Curious: How much of a threat is quantum computing to Bitcoin?,"  


[ How much of a threat is quantum computing to Bitcoin?](https://preview.redd.it/wk6rkb0b265e1.png?width=2000&format=png&auto=webp&s=f52700ca0a3afc26accec3666f84e09771d6f26a)

As a strong believer in Bitcoin and its decentralized nature, I’ve always admired how secure the network is. However, like many others, I’ve come across discussions about **quantum computing** and its potential ability to undermine the cryptographic systems that Bitcoin relies on. While I remain confident in Bitcoin's resilience, I want to expand my knowledge on this topic and understand the realistic implications.

From what I’ve read, the concern lies in quantum computers potentially breaking two key components of Bitcoin’s security are SHA-256 hashing and ECDSA. 

The fear seems to be that a sufficiently powerful quantum computer could:

* Reverse a private key from a public key, allowing an attacker to take control of funds. ( A sufficiently powerful quantum computer could calculate the private key from the public key in a short amount of time. - Which is impossible be done in near future.)
* Break the Proof-of-Work consensus, undermining the integrity of the blockchain. 

While this sounds alarming, I also understand that Bitcoin addresses aren’t exposed until funds are spent, meaning most addresses may not be vulnerable. And, quantum computing, as it stands today, is still far from having the computational power necessary to threaten Bitcoin at scale.

 That said, I would love to hear thoughts from you guys: Is this concern overblown or something to seriously prepare for in the near future? How might Bitcoin’s resilience evolve as quantum computing advances?

While I firmly believe in Bitcoin’s future, exploring these hypothetical scenarios is crucial to better understand the risks and how the community is preparing to address them.

Looking forward to hearing your insights. Thanks in advance for sharing your thoughts and knowledge!",1,5,Minimum_Pear_3195,Bitcoin

Since Bitcoin went over $100,000 yesterday, I was hanging out with a few of my friends and I asked them why they're still not interested in getting in to the whole crypto thing.....but mainly BITCOIN.

They all looked at me and they said how do you expect us to afford $100,000? I said what? They said yeah now that it's $100,000 we can't afford to get in???

I looked at them and I realized that they can't be the only ones that don't understand that you can still get in by buying SATS a little at a time to accumulate. 

Too Much hype is based on the whole coin price, we need to start talking about SATS to people so they understand better and it's not too late for them to join the revolution.",6,6,Local_Doubt_4029,Bitcoin

2024-12-06 03:37:13,Just wanted to say how meaningful Bitcoin hitting 100k was to me.,"I'll keep this short and sweet since I know nobody is gonna read this anyways, or it'll get removed, but id like to say that Bitcoin hitting 100k is proof that with patience, results will show. I was sitting in juvie in 2018 taking a financial statistics/algebra class and we got on the topic about crypto because at the time it was still a topic that a lot of the world was still getting familiar with. I remember we talked for days about Bitcoin and predicted where the value would end up in certain time frames. I remember the teacher told us that Bitcoin was supposedly going to hit 100k at the end of 2018, well needless to say that was wrong. But I had to have the last word. Just before I was released from juvie the teacher that talked about Bitcoin with us came and spoke to me about how to get a head start on life when I get out. And the right investments to make. And just before he left I said these exact words ""crypto will be the most disappointing short term investment I make. But since I'm a gambler I'll betchu anything that in 6 years it'll finally hit that 100k mark"" I had always believed that me and the number 6 was lucky and indeed it has been so far.

2024-12-06 01:08:26,I had a brother-in-law who was very convinced that Dollar Cost Averaging was bullshit ,"Unless you had a ton of money. He retorted that he knew exactly at which levels to buy into Bitcoin instead. He said he knew exactly how to read the chart to determine where the support levels are and when to cash out. He empathized that the cashing-out part was paramount for 'poor' dudes like us, which struck me as I saw Bitcoin as my main buy and hold asset, it was my strategy. I guess I was influenced a lot from Larry Jones and his 5-dollar cup of Coffee DCA philosophy.  

  
So I told him DCA is just as valid a strategy to take if you were to do Bitcoin trading. He wasn't having it, adding that only the rich can afford to do that as they can mindlessly just dump in money into BTC and it would work out for them anyways. He said for us we needed to really time the market. I replied then how can we properly predict where the market is going to go? He said there's clear signals on the chart, where you see the rallies and support levels, and then the resistance levels. These are where you can tell whether to buy or not, he told me like a precise science and that it was the truth. And I do see that it was truth, once I took in what he was saying. But I had doubts as to if this is THE consistent way that he was describing. 

  
It was the way he said it that surprised me, he was so convinced that this was the ONE correct way that nothing I said about how DCA works was entertained, much less considered as a valid strategy.  

  
He didn't strike me as someone who was particularly successful in trading or is super-rich off this strategy so I just let it slide because he was a relative.

TL;DR: It's buggy and laggy, could cause you losses/lose profit opportunities.

The reasons why I'm saying this are the following.

\- In many occasions when you're trying to go long/short, the app will welcome you with (Insufficient Funds) message, although you've more than enough funds. This could cause you to not get a positing on time, because you have to spam the long/short button until it works and maybe not, or you have to force stop the app and then clear the cache almost each time this happens! There are users who complained about this 6 whole years ago and it's still happening.

\- This happened to me twice and I was about to lose a hefty amount of money. One of them is when I was trying to have a position and go long, then the app showed me the very same annoying buggy (Insufficient funds) message, then I didn't take the position I needed and went to the next room at my house. One minute later and while I was at the other room, I heard the notification tone I made for Binance mobile app when one of my ordered is executed, although I didn't place it after I got (Insufficient funds) message 1 minute before, luckily I heard the notification and hurried to my mobile and found out the order was place after around 1 minute! I cancelled it before things were going badly. Now imagine the following scenario if I didn't neither heard that notification's sound, nor checked my mobile (let's say for hours), most probably I was going to lose much money if I didn't close my position on time with all of this volatility the market is currently facing.

  
I mean.. How much will it cost for Binance to fix and develop a reliable app with no problems like this. I'm sure the money they earn when they check the order book of different coins and counter trade against the majority of traders to liquidate them is more than enough to fund few programmers who can make a proper app.

Yo, Bitcoin hit the high just last night,  
Hundred K candles, man, it was bright.  
We were poppin' bottles, flexin’ big dreams,  
Woke up this morning—price ripped at the seams.

Blink and you’ll miss it, that’s the crypto grind,  
Up to the moon, then it leaves you behind.  
To my ex who blocked me—yo, how does it feel?  
Bitcoin’s the boss now; yeah, the gains are real.

I told her, “Hodl, babe, trust the plan,”  
She said, “Crypto’s fake, I need a real man!”  
Now she’s scrolling through charts, jaw on the floor,  
Watching Bitcoin do what I said before.

Blink and you’ll miss it, that’s the crypto grind,  
Breaking through walls, then leaving you blind.  
We smashed through 100K—what a feat,  
But twenty-four hours later? Man, we faced defeat.

The markets move fast, they don’t play fair,  
One minute you’re flying, next, gasping for air.  
But CoffeeShopCrypto? Yo, they called the dip,  
Fair value gaps—they laid out the script.

You didn’t watch the vid? Bro, that’s your loss,  
Could’ve placed those buys and still been the boss.  
Now you’re sitting here, staring at the pain,  
While others pick up the profits again.

Blink and you’ll miss it, that’s the Bitcoin ride,  
One second, you’re king, next, swallowed by pride.  
This game’s for the bold, the patient, the wise,  
So keep one eye open—don’t trust all the highs.

Next time Bitcoin’s flying the skies,  
Remember to follow the pros for the prize.  
CoffeeShopCrypto had the blueprint in hand,  
But you missed the boat, couldn’t make a stand.

Fair value gaps? Yeah, they’re real, my dude,  
Play it right, and you’ll shift the mood.  
From broke to boss in the blink of an eye,  
That’s the Bitcoin bounce—are you ready to try?",0,0,coffeeshopcrypto,Bitcoin
2024-12-05 23:10:51,Help lost old wallet,In December of 2013 I was buying fractions of bitcoins in ebay. I accrued roughly .01375 bitcoin. Yesterday when I saw bitcoin hit 100k I remember all about this wallet. I have the address to it but cant remember much else. Is there any way I can track down and recover it?

2024-12-05 22:59:08,"Late Adopter, But Still Early","First time posting. Despite a $6k average cost (due to about $500 bought around $6k), I'm still a late adopter because the bulk of my buying has occured post-$60k. This is a short statement on why I'm still DCA'ing and scooping $100+ quantities near $100k.

21 million coins. 20 million if Satoshi never sells.

Call it 8bn people on earth, majority ex-US.

On reddit and in the news, it feels like the ship has already sailed, because we are in the information bubble.

But step away one degree of knowledge (think the average american / parent / youth not to mention the billions of people still with limited information/wifi access) and you can imagine how easily BTC approaches $1mm-$10mm range by, say, 2050. It simply will take that long for the average person to ACTUALLY know a) what btc is and b) feel comfortable enough using it because others around them are also using it.

My basic thesis is that BTC will stabilize at a price where, say, 3-4bn people hold it. And by this time, it's no longer a speculative asset but actually a stable, useful one. 

TLDR; the majority of people who own BTC in the future will be quite similar to how people own USD or other ForEx today. For them (us) the US Dollar is not a speculative asset. It is just the way the world works. Nobody who owns USD expects it to wildly fluctuate. One day, BTC will be similar, and its daily use will be normalized in the fractions of a BTC, the same way we are comfortable with dollars and cents but don't expect anyone to walk around with a $1mm dollar bill..

I think the big misconception is that people are like, oh 1 BTC, that's like a $1 right?? But in reality, 1BTC will be to people what a $1mm dollar bill would be to us today. I.e. absurd to think about owning ""1"" of. And with that time frame in mind, we're all still early.

2024-12-05 22:56:50,You got lucky,"Feels like a good day for a brief victory lap. I wrote this in March 2024 as we started ascending and had some people coming out of the woodwork offering their commentary. Sent this back to show my own journey and encourage them to start theirs. Stay lucky, friends.

It seems to be happening, or at least continuing to happen. The commentary is as inevitable as the ascension. 

How many do you have?

Is it too late to buy? 

You got lucky. 

Questions are always welcome, albeit questions one and two will be answered tongue in cheek (not enough and more every day. The best day was yesterday, the second best is right now… to learn about it, at least). Question (or statement) three comes from more of an emotional than an inquisitive place. People will see early adopters as reckless gamblers at best, insufferable morons at worst, granted the “crypto” space has done little to put these accusations to rest. The truth is that my conviction crystallized when I realized that some of the most intelligent and thoughtful people I’ve ever heard speak, people in hard disciplines ranging from tech to finance to philosophy to economics and history to energy and monetary policy, all had one thing in common: Conviction. A hard conviction formed from work applied. Forged in fire, refined, sharpened, and polished: belief. Ready to defend an idea that’s impossible to unsee after being seen. Coupled with the (usually) thoughtless, hyperbolic, and low-rung attacks from parties or individuals who are unwilling to educate themselves? Proof of work, indeed.

Of course, we all had some luck along the way, good and bad. Luck was when I first bought BTC at $17 in 2012 to buy pot on the internet. Misfortune was selling whatever I had left at $500, thinking I was a genius, and forgetting about it until I got lucky again in the hype cycle of 2018. I bought all the way to the top and unluckily pissed it all away by thinking I was a trading prodigy, a soothsayer of shitcoins. Good luck then struck again in two ways: Firstly, in the fraud and fuckery of a crypto hype cycle, BTC was relegated to irrelevance. It was a fun gamble for “geniuses” like me who made and lost more cash than they’d ever thought they’d have; now it was time to fade away and die. The second streak of luck was that I personally knew someone who had seen what I eventually would. Who actually managed to hold on to some of their 2018 profits and continued to buy BTC all the way down $3.8k, unperturbed. 

I didn’t get it. The jig was up. They were throwing money away. How can someone so smart be so clearly wrong, so quick to continue to gamble away their hard-earned money? Luckily, again, this person was willing to provide patient explanations and finished with, “$3k for a Bitcoin is insane. I hate telling anyone to do anything (no upside), but the only regret you’ll have in buying now is that you didn’t buy more”. Luckily or unluckily, I listened (not enough). But, in the luckiest strike of all; I couldn’t shake what they had told me before the buy recommendation. The arguments and conviction piqued my curiosity. The work began.

I began to read, listen, and learn. Countless hours asking questions and finding answers until finally, a faint understanding began to form. I found rabbit holes in the rabbit holes. I reached the limits of my technical understanding (it wasn’t much). I began to have ideas that I could articulate to others and recognize nonsensical, emotional arguments. I began to see flaws in what we currently accept, and oncoming trains in the distance, gaining speed. I wish I could distill it down to you here, but it’s not possible. The concept of an “orange pill” (providing the points necessary for someone to quickly understand BTC) does not exist. There are many communicators doing their best, but hopefully you can understand that nothing worthwhile comes easy, and nothing that comes easy lasts. I wish I was lucky enough to have thrown everything I had at BTC in 2012 and again in 2018. The truth is, it wouldn’t have lasted. I would have panic sold, been tempted to trade in my hubris, shitcoined, or some combination of all three, left with nothing but bitterness as BTC kept rising and got further out of reach. A sloppy build on a weak foundation cannot not weather the storm.

I began to dollar cost average and smash buy dips. HODLed. Self custody. Ran a node. Began to look at the rising price and feel nothing but a faint sense of “duh” because I already knew the real value of what I was accumulating. I found myself wishing it would crash just to have the opportunity to buy more at a discount. While most people are gambling on the concept, some are waking up, but we all get BTC at the price that we deserve. May your foundation be solid and your build strong. This train stops for no one.

I also recognize that the work is nowhere near done. BTC devs need support, hurdles of scale to the masses, and an always unknowable future. There are a myriad technical hurdles that I cannot pretend to understand. Governmental threats can absolutely slow the transition; you’re kidding yourself if you think your benign overlords will let a superior ledger prevail based on merits alone. Obscene taxes could be levied. Masses will be angry and convinced that we’re all lucky assholes. We all kind of are. Lucky enough to have wanted to learn, at least. The work never ends.

And to those who think they’re too late, consider this: your ship is taking on water. Bitcoin is your personal lifeboat. Don’t be too proud to captain your own lifeboat because you wanted a bigger one. You’ll end up on a dinghy or in the water.

Or even worse, a passenger on another captain's boat that is also sinking- but the boat has a bunch of lame gizmos on it, and the crew says that one day it’ll be the nicest boat in the world. That’s a shitboat. Avoid that boat at all costs.

There may not be an orange pill, but there is a well-balanced orange diet and exercise routine. Here are some resources that I consider helpful to the learning process.

2024-12-05 21:43:10,The Biggest Question: Bitcoin with or without KYC ,"A few months ago I decided to bet all my chips on the power and philosophy behind bitcoin. Not just as something speculative, but as the only salvation in a rotten fiat system where our purchasing power melts every day to enrich corrupt politicians who print money as if they were the owners of the world.   
  
In the midst of this decision, I have only been purchasing bitcoin via P2P, to stay off the government's radar. However, upon studying more, I have come to the conclusion that it may be a mistake to buy only P2P, and perhaps I need to buy from an exchange, even if it is 50/50. Thus, proven possession bitcoins will allow me to buy goods such as a house, car, or other things with that money. Bearing in mind that (at least here in Brazil) if a lot of money appears out of nowhere without proof, it can lead to jail time.   
  
So I would like to open this discussion to those educated people who have some opinion on this and can add their knowledge. (I'd like to avoid maximalist answers in which bitcoin has a religious, fanatical bias behind it).  
  
I would also like to ask if someone buys and sells on an exchange, could you suggest which one would be interesting to sell bitcoins purchased outside (like p2p for example), send it to CEX and sell it there without the risk of being blocked? Some people say that Binance tends to block external bitcoins.",1,8,SevenShivas,Bitcoin

2024-12-05 20:05:43,I went from broke to millionaire in 7 years on a middle-class income thanks to Bitcoin,"I'm posting this anonymously for obvious reasons.

I shared my story here four years ago. If you are curious, you can find it. I've been involved with r/Bitcoin since the summer of 2017 when I first bought Bitcoin in the $2,000 range. I distinctly remember celebrating 250,000 subs here, and this subreddit has been a great educational and meme-motivational resource over that time. 

The Bull Market of 2017 was a wild ride. I experienced my first FOMO as the price went from $2,000 to $20,000. During that up-and-down cycle, I bought around one whole Bitcoin. I bought another full Bitcoin when it dropped to $4,000 in 2018. I felt satisfied with my 2 BTC, but my confidence waned so I didn’t continue stacking over the next 2 years. 

In the spring of 2020, I sold my house, switched jobs, and suddenly found myself sitting on $30,000 in cash from the sale of my home and around 55k in a 401k. I watched as Bitcoin went from 4k to 7, 8, 9, 10, instead of going down to zero as the critics claimed. I decided to go “all-in” with these funds so that’s what I did. I bought around 3 Bitcoin with the cash and the equivalent of just under 5 BTC in GBTC in a new 401k. This brought me to just under 10 Bitcoin split between private custody and a 401k. 

I watched history repeat itself in the fall of 2020, but this time, I had some real exposure to better gains. I watched as my life savings went from around $100,000 to over $600,000 at the top of the cycle in early 2021. Then, I watched as my roughly $600,000 returned to around $170,000 during the bottom of the bear market in 2022. That was tough to witness, but I looked at it and said “I’m still up from where I started.” Once you get past a certain amount of savings, the big swings hit differently. Even during the bear market, I knew I still had at least a 1-year emergency fund, which comforted me.Fast-forward to a short while ago when Bitcoin hit 92k. I soon realized that with the equity in our home and my exposure to BTC, my wife and I were finally millionaires. We’re still driving the same beater cars to work. I rarely sell our BTC, but when I do, I try to buy things/ experiences that will improve the quality of life for my family, and I’m quick to replace what I sold.   
  
I make a middle-class income so I don’t often need to sell for the things I want/ need. Whenever I see a used car, 4-wheeler, boat, or new home I’m tempted to buy, I think to myself “I’d rather have Bitcoin.” The peace of mind it offers far outweighs the benefits of more junk. I used to tell myself I’d pay off my mortgage using proceeds from Bitcoin, but my mortgage is only about 9% of my take-home pay, and the interest rate is lower than inflation. I believe we will see 250k-280k by the end of next year, and the cycle will start again.   
  
One downside to having such a nice safety net is that work has become very tedious. I have very little motivation to put in the extra time or to go “above and beyond.” I do my job, I do it well, I make money for my employer, but I’m not pushing for more like I would if I were still broke. I’ll post again in four more years with an update. I’m hoping to retire by 2030-2034. Stay safe out there, and only invest in Bitcoin what you’re willing to keep!",4406,376,Anon_Bitcoin_Dude,Bitcoin
2024-12-05 20:04:53,Bitcoin hitting 100k is a victory for the middle class,"A few years back, most folks treated Bitcoin like a silly internet toy or a passing fad. But today? It’s holding up a mirror to a financial system that’s gotten too comfortable playing its own games, forgetting the regular people who’ve worked and saved and stressed over every damn paycheck. Instead of us just shrugging and going along with the old rules, suddenly we have something that says, “Hey, maybe our efforts—our day-to-day hustling, our attempts to build a better life—matter more than we realized.”

Because when a digital currency—a thing of pure code and consensus—reaches that kind of value, it’s not just about the price. It’s about the power shift. It’s about putting more tools in the hands of teachers, small business owners, delivery drivers—people who’ve had to watch their earnings barely keep pace with rent hikes and health insurance premiums and the nagging feeling that they’re one emergency away from losing it all.

Seeing Bitcoin at a hundred grand makes me think that maybe we can tilt the playing field back toward the middle class. Maybe it means you don’t have to be born into the right zip code or old money connections to protect the fruits of your labor. Maybe it means you can stash a bit of your hard-earned pay in a place that isn’t constantly chipping away at its value. It’s a quiet victory, but an important one—the kind of moment that can inspire a new generation to question the way things work and to demand better.

Look, I’m not saying Bitcoin alone is going to save the world or fix every broken piece of our system. But I can’t ignore the hope this moment brings. It’s a spark—a reminder that we can dream bigger, that we can take control, that we can make choices that aren’t dictated by some distant boardroom. It’s a chance for the middle class to become more than just a statistic, more than a casualty in the endless tug-of-war between billionaires and bureaucrats.

So yeah, Bitcoin hit a hundred thousand dollars. And honestly, I’m excited. I’m excited for what this means for people who’ve always been told to settle for less. I’m excited that maybe this technology is showing us a door where we once only saw a wall. There’s a new story unfolding here, and if we play our cards right, it just might help us write a brighter chapter for everyone.

However It's assumed that in the future, Quantum computing power will be able to brute force simple seed phrases, but as technology advances, the security of wallets will become more complex keeping the brute force techniques at bay (we hope) 

But those lost wallets will not have the advantage of increased security. If you have an old wallet in a landfill with a simple 12 word seed phrase, one day it WILL be brute forced. So my hypothesis is that much of the lost coin will be 'found' and probably spin up a whole new industry of mining for lost coin when computing power enables it. ",3,15,coop3548,Bitcoin

The first time i had to perform a wipe was a few years ago i was a nervous mess thinking i messed something up as i fumbled thru the restore. It worked everything was there.

This week my balances wouldnt load. Updated suite, updated firmware. Nothing. I then checked my seed phrase against the in-suite check. Cool it matches. Now to wipe... not bad at all as i had all info in front of me and gave me good practice for using the touch screen input. Spend some time with this keyboard it's not difficult but becomes difficult in a panic. Restore successful and labeling also was saved because it was local.

2024-12-05 17:31:49,"""In a world where Bitcoin keeps increasing in value, no-one is going to spend it"" - yes they will. Let me explain why.","**For those new to Bitcoin:**

# Have you ever wondered why your parents could buy a house and a car on one salary, but today we're all grinding just to keep up? 

Spoiler alert: it's not because stuff is actually getting more expensive—it's because our money is broken. 

Bitcoin fixes this.

**The Illusion of Expensive Stuff**

Technology is making everything more efficient. Think about it: producing goods is cheaper and faster than ever before. The natural order should be that prices *drop* over time. But thanks to money printing and inflation, we're stuck in a world where prices *seem* to rise. It's like running on a treadmill that's speeding up—you have to work harder just to stay in the same place.

**Bitcoin Flips the Script**

Bitcoin is deflationary by design. There's a capped supply, so it can't be devalued by printing more. When Bitcoin underpins the economy, it aligns with the natural order—stuff gets cheaper over time because your money holds its value (or even appreciates). That's not (only) because bitcoin is ""increasing in value"", rather, Bitcoin represents the true order of things. When our protocol for ""value"" is not expanding; you notice how the world is actually prosperous. Less ""stuff"" automatically funnels to the richest class just because they hold ""stuff"" (equities, homes, etc.) already.

**Housing: From Asset to Shelter**

For instance; have you ever thought about why houses are so expensive? It's not *just* demand; it's because people use real estate as a store of value to hedge against inflation. With Bitcoin as a reliable store of value, there's less incentive to park wealth in houses. This could *demonetize* housing, stripping away the investment premium and making homes more affordable for everyone.

**Better Savings for All**

When your money appreciates over time, saving becomes rewarding—not just for the rich but for everyone. You don't need complex investment strategies to preserve wealth. This encourages responsible spending and reduces unnecessary consumption driven by the fear of money losing value.

**Global Settlement and Fair Play**

Bitcoin as the default value-storing unit levels the playing field. International settlements become straightforward, transparent, and fair. No more currency manipulations or unfair advantages. Everyone operates with the same rules, benefiting global trade and cooperation.

**But Won't People Stop Spending?**

Not really. People still need to live, enjoy experiences, and buy stuff. I just bought a car half a year ago, for instance, knowing full and well that that money would have appreciated had I put it in Bitcoin—or stocks— instead. The key is that spending becomes more intentional. Instead of splurging because money is losing value, purchases are made based on actual need and desire. Plus, an appreciating currency doesn't halt spending—it just curbs wasteful consumption. In most cases, this is actually good for our planet as well.

So, in a nutshell: Bitcoin realigns the economy with the natural progression of technology and efficiency. Prices should fall; therefore savings should grow, and everyone gets a fair shot at prosperity. Whether you're born in Manhattan or Zanzibar.

Personally, I'm ready for a world where my money works *for* me, and not against me.

2024-12-05 16:20:39,"My Bitcoin Journey, and 12 Years of FUD.","I first got into Bitcoin in early 2013. I had been primed by the likes of Ron Paul's anti-Fed campaign in 2012, and the works of Austrian economists like Hayek who spoke of a system of competing currencies. I read The Creature from Jekyll Island, and my world was shattered. After revisiting the white paper, everything finally clicked, and I made my first purchase for around like $40 each.

I became that annoying Bitcoin kid at school. Everyone made fun of me for supporting some weird magic internet money, especially so after the Mt. Gox ordeal and the following price crash. Me and my Bitcoin loving friends were still just dumb teenagers, and we spent our coins on illicit goods via the Silk Road. We thought we were pretty badass surfing the dark net, when in reality we were just your typical degenerate rebellious teens.

Fast forward to 2015-2016, when I first acquired the stack I still have today, paid for by my minimum wage odd jobs. When it later made its crazy run to 17k, that's when I first remember Bitcoin making a massive splash into popular culture. I would pass people on the street looking at their Coinbase account. People would talk about this coin, that ICO, what have you. Some of my initial doubters messaged me asking about how to buy Bitcoin, what it is, etc.

Most of my time, however, was spent consuming educational resources on the nuts and bolts of how Bitcoin works, such as Andreas' Mastering Bitcoin. This was around when everyone was debating about the block size, which encouraged me to learn more about how it really works. At the time, it was a massive ordeal and many considered it to be an existential threat to the network itself. Looking back, it was just one additional bump in a very bumpy road.

I must have had a horseshoe up my rear end, because I sold part of my stack around $17k right before the massive crash. I later bought back in and shipped it away to cold storage, where it has been ever since.

In this early period, I was much more neurotic about price movements, and must more zealous about my evangelism. Later on, however, having been through multiple bull and bear markets, I've calmed down significantly. Back in 2013, Bitcoin hitting $10k was some crazy dream. We were just a bunch of cypherpunks and libertarians trying to stick it to the man, disillusioned with politics after Ron Paul's campaign ended in 2012. We knew that it had a crazy high ceiling in theory, but whether or not it would get there was a whole other story. 

After it hit $10k and especially after it stabilized around a bottom of $3k after the crash, things became a lot more real for me, at least. In my mind, the hardest trials were already behind us. It had gone through multiple crashes, countless obituaries had aged like milk, and still it persisted. The block size wars were resolved, people were still building on it, and more and more major players started to enter the space. 2018 was probably the year that I knew in no uncertain terms that Bitcoin was truly here to stay, and that it was only a matter of time before hyperbitcoinization.

Nowadays, every story about X nation, person, company, etc. getting into Bitcoin comes as no surprise. My parents keep nagging me about when I'm going to sell, and I simply just tell them that when I'm ready, I won't have to. In our lifetime, we're going to see the current iteration of most of this generation's fiat currencies fail. They all fail at some point or another, and Bitcoin is the lifeboat that can't be taken away from you. 

More companies and nations will hold it as a strategic reserve asset. The US will be forced to if they want to ensure the supremacy of the US dollar, let alone if they're even able to. More countries will adopt it as legal tender. The volatility and accumulation will continue, until everyone is operating on the Bitcoin standard. L2 solutions that consist of payment channels, federated networks, etc. will grow in sophistication, complexity, and adoption. More and more, isolated sources of renewable energy will be tapped for the first time, powered by Bitcoin's PoW consensus.

2024-12-05 15:46:00,Turning Bagels into Bitcoin,"Cheers to $100k everyone. Today is a great day, so I thought I'd drop a story here as inspiration for what has kept us hodling for years and stacking for the many more to come.

Like many of you, I've felt the pinch of the economic conditions over the past few years. I have a wife and kids and work a career job in the non-profit world. I love my family. I love my job. But I'm probably never going to see a six-figure salary in my lifetime. And that's ok: I chose this career path, try to live within my means, and don't want anyone to feel sorry for me when finances are tight. As I surveyed my family's financial situation during COVID, I had to be honest with myself that I would probably never see multiple commas in my financial accounts. But the more I learned about Bitcoin, the more I began to believe in Bitcoin. It truly could be my ace in the hole for building and preserving wealth for my wife, kids, and grandkids one day.

As inflation spiked my bills and ate away at the margins of my family budget, I knew something had to change... or even drop. It wasn't going to be contributing to my kids' college funds. It wasn't going to be contributing to my 403(b). *It wasn't going to be my weekly DCA into BTC*. But that meant I had to get creative to find an additional source of income. But what can you do if you're already working a 9-5 job and want to keep your evenings and weekends for your kids' soccer games or a dessert date with your spouse?

*Make bagels at 5:00am.*

I mean, I wasn't particularly busy at 5:00am. Not many of us are. My wife is still asleep. My kids are still asleep. Might as well turn some bagels into some money. I'm fortunate to have a good friend from college who's started a few successful restaurants in my town. One of them is a bagel shop that's become very popular. So I shot him a text seeing if he needed any help in the early mornings. He immediately offered me a job as a baker: *5-8am, a few hundred bagels per shift, a few shifts per week, as soon as I'm done baking the openers arrive and I can head to my regular 9-5 job*. Plus, I get to take a free bagel & coffee on my way out the door. Say less. I submitted my I-9 documents. Enrolled in direct deposit. Side-hustle secured.

It's been two years, and I couldn't be happier with how it's worked out. Sure, that 4:30am alarm can be brutal — especially when my 4 year-old wakes up in the middle of the night, or my wife needs me to rock the baby to sleep so she can get some rest herself. But making bagels has given me the extra few-hundred dollars per month to be able to breathe again. Bagels now cover my utilities. That's been huge. But more importantly, *bagels turn into my Bitcoin*. Two years of keeping my weekly DCA going has made all the difference in my family's financial outlook. BTC is going to help me buy my oldest his first car. BTC is going to help me put my kids through college. BTC might just help my wife and I retire a little bit better than we deserve. Yeah, a chirping 4:30am alarm, a long day at my 9-5, a loud evening wrestling with my kids and vacuuming up Cheerios mashed into the carpet make me collapse into my pillow at 10:00pm... just in time to do it all over again the next morning.

But this is why we do it. This is the hope that Bitcoin gives us. The chance to do something different to build wealth. The chance to be creative at the margins, and turn the margins into gains. For most of us, our lives are pretty ordinary. But turning the ordinary into something extraordinary like Bitcoin is a special feeling. It's the feeling that keeps me going — bleary-eyed, in the back of a fluorescent-lit kitchen while it's still dark outside. Who knew that bagels can turn into Bitcoin? Find your ""bagels,"" whatever that is. Turn it into some BTC, and enjoy the ride. I'll be right there with you.",5,1,reed_colson,Bitcoin

I don't watch TV (don't even have one) so I don't know what the talking heads will say this morning, but if it's like the news sites. I expect coverage to be rather muted.

Yahoo Finance has an article (or two) and while it was briefly the top story last night, it no longer is this morning.

BBC news also has an article but it's buried (understandably) by the coverage of the Bian Thompson (RIP) slaying. 

As the saying goes ""if it bleeds it leads"". So it's understandable that that is the focus of the coverage. I hope they catch the killer, although I suspect he won't be found. Regardless of what you may think of insurance companies this is a terrible thing to occur. ",3,4,jarviez,Bitcoin

2024-12-05 14:43:11,Imagine Satoshi Nakamoto in Sharktank ,"<Satoshi entering the Shark Tank>

Have you ever heard about inflation? Have you ever tried to save money in the bank? Have you ever negotiated a salary increase only to find out that your costs of living increase more? 


Hi my name is Satoshi Nakamoto and that is my real name (it’s not) and I am seeking an investment of $100,000 for a 21 millionth of equity stake in my new invention, the Bitcoin.



Most people live in countries with inflation. In some countries it is like slow-boiling a frog, people don’t notice. But in some other countries with double digit inflation or higher, you have to get rid of your cash immediately, or lose a big part of it.



Furthermore; for tax reasons all companies in the world do their accounting in their own local currency.  Since a company can be profitable or not profitable depending on in which currency you do the accounting, it is almost impossible to know which companies are profitable in real terms. The market economy is not working as it should. 


Having the ability to do accounting in an international ledger currency would be an amazing step forward and would also help stopping illegal state subsidies, tax havens and group loan interest rates not reflecting real loan costs.

In most western countries we have seen increasing house prices although with new techniques building a house should be cheaper than ever. Children cannot buy a similar house or apartment as their parents even though they have gone to school
more years. Because of excessive money printing, cheap loans and human nature, only looking at monhtly costs, buyers have found themselves in bidding wars and house prices have soared. For most families their house or their apartment has been their only significant store of value. At the same time, rich people have bought real estate they don’t intend to use themselves for passive income and as a store of value to escape inflation. 


My invention is a much better store of value. This means house prices can adjust to what people are willing to pay to live there themselves without seeing it as an investment and a store of value. 

In many (mostly eastern) countries it has been popular to invest, or rather, save money, in gold. This is quite impractical and risky. But this has been their only option.

My invention is solving the problems with inflation and store of value and gives multinational companies an alternative to only local currency bookkeeping. You can also always access your money from anywhere regardless of borders.



Any individual, company, institution, city, region, state or country can use my invention to store their value, short term or long term.



Moreover with my invention, people can become their own banks and we won’t have to see bank runs or bank liquidity crises like Washington Mutual again. Remember the headline of The Times 03/Jan/2009 Chancellor on brink of second bailout for banks

Because of the brutal first mover network effect it can’t be copied and its value is going to go up forever, Laura.


Even though a bitcoin is extremely divisible into small amounts, for retail online shopping and smaller transactions we are still relying on a combination of level two, level three and level four solutions, because frankly, not every little small purchase needs to be stored forever.


Even though the easiest and most risk free way is to simply save your money in bitcoin (buy and hodl) the built-in four year cycle with both low and high prices over each cycle gives everyone a chance to buy in low and sell high if they so choose, which has, similar to arbitrage, a stabilizing effect on the price of the following cycle. After 6-10 cycles the price fluctuations in real terms should be insignificant enough for bitcoin to be a real contender when it comes to replacing any country’s currency.

Now I am ready to take your questions.

2024-12-05 09:11:08,$100k!  Asking if it is too late?  Want to know if you should sell?  Read this.,"Here's the thing to understand.  On a long enough time scale, one satoshi is worth more than all the dollars that will ever exist.  Bitcoin is simply a better way to store buying power than dollars.  To quote Saylor, is it too late to adopt cars over a horse and buggy?   

[Am I too late to buy a car?  Prices are at an all time high!](https://preview.redd.it/xxuwfl6mwz4e1.jpg?width=750&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=7281af6f786fb7d620170050619697299276e291)

Dollars, yen, rubles... these will all go extinct, and it could happen suddenly at any time in a hyper-bitcoinization event.  Bitcoin is the replacement for money.  You're not investing in bitcoin, you are getting the price you deserve... when you have the done the homework... to build the confidence to buy bitcoin permanently and leave the fiat system for good.  Is it too late to get in the life boat?  It's never too late.  Should you sell and get out of the life boat?  No\*\*.  Everyone will get in eventually.  Some will get a nice return by getting in earlier.  As more jump in, the return drops.  But even the last person on the boat is making a good decision!  They will get a fair amount of buying power for what they own.

This is the key to understanding bitcoin.  The last person on the boat isn't a sucker right before the big crash.  When the last person gets on board, we don't measure bitcoin in dollars... we measure it in butter, and shoes, and all the other goods and services we want.  We measure the cost of these things in satoshis, and that cost will continue to fall.  That's what ""going up"" means, in time.  

[Bitcoiners building another sucker who wants bitcoin](https://preview.redd.it/lh833yjjxz4e1.jpg?width=1200&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=badb4668ab98276764a317a6e9da2da6340c91ac)

Even when the last person converts to bitcoin, there's still so much more demand coming!  Humans will still work to create wealth.  This new wealth will want to store itself in bitcoin.  People will still be fucking, new humans are born, and these new people will want to store value when they are young so they can spend in old age.  And they will be right to expect to sell that bitcoin to the next generation in retirement.

  
It's going up forever Laura!  (love you Laura it's just a funny meme)

[No, really.  It's going up forever.](https://preview.redd.it/2iaeijy6xz4e1.jpg?width=1500&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=70fbff6f88df3c9f2733d553df2e322f1f436d4d)

  
\*\* if you are a professional trader, it could make sense to try to time the market.  But that's nothing unique to bitcoin, it's true of every asset.  If you're good at trading, be a trader.  If not, and trust me you probably aren't good enough... then DON'T!",0,6,BitcoinBaller420,Bitcoin

In fact, It seemed like it was completely trying to cheat and I can no longer support this community for putting up with such obvious crime.  If you ""wanted"" bitcoin, 4% down is not a deal.  And on top of that, you would most likely not do that sort of thing to ""convince"" people its ""going up"" unless you were breaking the law.

2024-12-05 07:38:55,How do you handle Bitcoin regret?,"I’m fully aware that my situation isn’t unique—many others share the same or even worse experiences. For the past three years, I’ve been content watching BTC's price climb slowly, appreciating the modest gains I made. But ever since BTC surged after the US election, I’ve been overwhelmed by deep, persistent regret that I just can’t shake.

My first encounter with BTC was around 2011 when it was worth less than $1. At the time, I had no idea what I was looking at. At 21, I was already interested in ways to make money, but I focused on stupid schemes like PPC link-mailers with referral systems. I earned fractions of a cent to receive ads via email and click on links. I even invested in a guy who claimed to flip domains for profit—only to lose a few thousand dollars when it turned out to be a scam (surprise, surprise).

When I looked at BTC back then, I saw only the mining aspect. I was convinced it wouldn’t work with my hardware and didn’t even consider investing just $10 for fun.

Fast forward to when BTC reached $30. I looked at it again and still believed I couldn’t mine it. Thankfully, I decided to buy 2 BTC, even though I felt we’d already hit the top—100x growth seemed like the limit, right? Unfortunately, I stumbled upon a website that promised to use my BTC to buy mining hardware and pay me a share of the profits. It sounded great at the time, but it was obviously a scam. A few weeks later, the site disappeared with my BTC. Even that modest investment would be worth over $200,000 today.

I didn’t think much about BTC again until 2020/2021 when the hype around shitcoins started. I got interested but not enough to do my own research. Instead, I followed the advice of so-called ""gurus."" Unsurprisingly, I was always a little too late to the party and never made any money. Discouraged, I left the crypto space again. However, I made one good decision: I bought a fraction of a coin at a price of about $6,000.

Today, I have made a 16x return, which is great, but it doesn’t feel like a significant win. I’m fortunate to be in a good financial position with two income sources, and having some extra is nice, but it’s not life-changing.

In recent years, my investing strategy has become conservative and somewhat lazy. Each month, I put a bit into the MSCI World ETF, and the rest goes into my Trade Republic account for 3.25% annual interest. I was happy with this approach until BTC’s recent surge.

Watching BTC gain another 40% in the last month (or 140% this year) has filled me with regret—not just about the early opportunities I missed, which could have changed my life with a $10 investment, but also about the more recent ones. I could have easily invested much more in BTC in 2021 or at least started DCAing small amounts over the years. But I didn’t, and I deeply regret it.

The regret isn’t just financial; it’s personal. I feel disappointed in myself and my decisions. I’ve always been interested in making money and investing, and I believed I was smart enough to recognize opportunities when they hit me in the face. I know I’ve missed many life-changing events in my 34 years—Apple, Microsoft, Amazon... even GameStop. But I wasn’t in the right circles to notice those chances, so I don’t blame myself for missing them. Crypto, however, is different. I was there from the very beginning. Life handed me several chances to see it and act, but I wasted my time on TikTok and idle games instead.

Now that BTC has broken $100,000, my mind is spinning. I’m torn on what to do next. On one hand, I know this isn’t the top. On the other hand, even if BTC goes to $200,000, that’s just a 2x gain, which feels insignificant compared to everything I’ve missed. If I decide to invest, I'm still left with the question of whether I should start slowly DCAing or just YOLO my savings instead of settling for 3.25% annual interest. I'm stuck and can already feel the Crypto Gurus creeping up on me again.

So, what’s the point of this post? I’m not looking for investment advice. Instead, I’m struggling with these regrets and didn’t expect to feel this way. By sharing my worries here, I hope to relieve some of this mental weight. Maybe I’ll also find people who can share advice on shifting my mindset.

I know my situation isn’t unique. From reading other posts, I’ve seen that many have it worse—people who lost huge amounts, sold too early, or even became millionaires but can’t access their wallets. But those posts rarely mention how they deal with the regret. Any advice on that would be greatly appreciated. And even if you don’t have advice but made it to the end of this long post—thank you for your time. I truly appreciate it.",3,3,JuWu90,Bitcoin

2024-12-05 07:05:41,Lets not forget who got us here: thank you Hal Finney!,"
Hal Finney was the first person to download the Bitcoin software, the first person to suggest code fixes to Satoshi Nakamoto and the first peer to trustlessly receive a transaction – all before BTC had a quotable price.

Finney was tragically diagnosed with ALS in August 2009, seven months after he and Satoshi started working on Bitcoin together. ALS is a fatal disease that attacks the central nervous system and finally causes paralysis.

Finney maintained his positive outlook and good spirits despite the sluggish development of his task. “Since we’re all rich with Bitcoins, or we will be once they’re worth a million dollars like everyone expects, we ought to put some of this unearned wealth to good use,” he said in a post on the Bitcointalk site.

""My dream is to contribute to open source software projects even from within an immobile body. That will be a life very much worth living.""

**Modesty is THE hallmark of a legend.**
Truly missed...

Fun fact: In 2009 Hal Finney predicted $10M per Bitcoin. [He divided the world's wealth by 20 million and NOT 21 million](https://np.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/s/L71ePyfHbg). Did Hal imply that Satoshi would never spend his coins?",2890,101,Nirbhik,Bitcoin

2024-12-05 06:14:58,You Should Know: Long-Term Risks of KYC Exchanges,"When it comes to buying BTC on ""know your customer"" (KYC) centralized exchanges, most people are aware of the surveillance and privacy loss aspects associated with it (although the majority downplays this but that's another topic...). However, there's one thing I don't see being discussed at all: the very long-term impact of one single KYC exchange buy order.

Once KYC exchanges have your personal information and allow you to execute an order, depending on the jurisdiction, they are obligated to keep your personal information for at least 10 years. In other words, even after a deletion request of your account on the exchange, your personal information could fall in the hands of bad actors over a time span of 10 whole years! This could be due to security vulnerabilities being exploited, human mistakes or enforcement by the government.

I'd highly recommend any person to look into non-KYC options like Bisq or RoboSats.",2,1,Tricky_Coconut392,Bitcoin

But with this milestone in hand, perhaps now is the time to rethink how we discuss Bitcoin’s price?

[At time of posting :\)](https://preview.redd.it/g4oar61wzy4e1.png?width=198&format=png&auto=webp&s=7a8f718e0f0dad624a5313e68d870f15ddc0b21f)

Instead of measuring Bitcoin in **dollars per BTC**, we should all work to normalise **sats per dollar** as the standsrd:

* $1 = 1,000 sats (at $100K/BTC)
* $10 = 10,000 sats
* $100 = 100,000 sats

**Why this makes sense:**

1. **Accessibility:** Most people can’t afford a whole Bitcoin. Talking in sats shows how Bitcoin can be divided and used.
2. **Adoption:** Pricing in sats makes Bitcoin more approachable for newcomers.
3. **Shift the Narrative:** Let’s promote Bitcoin as money, not just a speculative asset.

If Bitcoin is the future, especially now that a dollar get you less than 1000 sats, shouldn’t we start discussing price according to its smallest unit? 

Let’s make sats the standard, especially when quoting price. What do y'all think?",0,1,CasaSatoshi,Bitcoin

The price is going to continue what it has been doing for as long as the denominator is US dollars, which declines every year.

What an incredible milestone for the world of crypto, and it’s hard to believe we’ve come this far. But the real question is: **Is this just the beginning, or are we looking at the top?**

💡 **What’s driving this surge?**

* **Institutional Interest:** More and more big names are jumping into the crypto space, adding legitimacy to BTC. 💼
* **Global Economic Uncertainty:** With inflation fears and traditional markets struggling, Bitcoin is looking like a safe haven for many. 🌍
* **Adoption is growing:** From El Salvador adopting it as legal tender to big corporations like Tesla holding Bitcoin, the momentum is real. 🚗🔋

💬 **What’s next?**  
Is this 100k USD just a stepping stone for Bitcoin to break new all-time highs? 🏆 Will it hit 150k, 200k, or even higher in the coming months? Or is it time for a market correction? 🤔

* **2017:** Bitcoin's first major bull run to 20.000 USD.
* **2020-2021:** Institutional adoption with companies like MicroStrategy and Tesla adding Bitcoin to their balance sheets.
* **2024:** Bitcoin finally crossing the 100k mark.

I’ve never been to a country with a worthless currency, Does all people in poor countries use Bitcoin instead of their actual currency?

Took advantage of dips.  Pushed harder for my family to buy in.  Explaining what the hell bitcoin is and how it will change the world.  Lots of proud moments, but this one is life changing.

To one of my best friends and his brother, thanks for letting me know about this gem.  To the community, love seeing the positive support and curiosity in how it works.

2024-12-05 03:11:48,Why crypto is the worst investment in the world ,Banks can technically put infinite money into an account and buy every bitcoin. Bitcoin has no safeguards for something like that. Just something I thought of when my friend brought it up as a possible investment opportunity. Bitcoin will go up as the usd goes down but what happens when we change from usd to something new. Bitcoin is not a safe investment strategy. That’s not even considering that if you buy bitcoin at $100000 you will be charged a 3k fee(up to 6k)just for buying then have to pay another fee to sell or send. Just my thoughts on bitcoin. No hard feelings bitcoiners. Why do you buy bitcoin for a store of value or for your daily transactions?,0,30,Maleficent_Grand8585,Bitcoin

Think about how destabilizing that would be - a nation relying on bitcoin sees its entire currency hacked and destablized by the creation of synthetic block chains, previously thought impossible due to the resource requirement.

Even just a handful of meddling would be a groundbreaking moment - suddenly - payments are re-routed, invalidaded. There are duplicate blockchains but they've somehow created too many duplicates (trillions) and no one is able to actually proof anything becouse of all the bloat.

No one would even know if a country decided to secretly create money to suddenly buy up the majority of the blockchain.

As bitcoin adoption increases (faster than the internet) most people suggest storing it in a metal seed phrase plate, which is built to be indestructible - imo a double edged sword. I think the whole purpose of keeping bitcoin was complete self custody of your coins, yet if you carry your metal indestructible plate around everywhere it’s definitely going to be investigated in the airport at some point as metal is an extremely detectable element during x ray scans etc. also if many people are dissatisfied with their current living standards, they can start a new life in a different country or move to jurisdictions that openly accept bitcoin such as El Salvador from countries such as USA, Canada, Australia, UK etc. with extremely robust technologies and security protocols in place. Im sure many cybersecurity experts are aware of this and intend to search all your devices under any suspicion that we are carrying these words around. Which has happened to me a number of times as a frequent traveller. Although, for people who don’t travel as much and have a mortgage (which is in rapid decline globally) are usually contempt with staying in one country their whole lives.

So quick rundown I linked my coinbase wallet to phantom,

Phantom wallet (my coinbase wallet) is 1 on the""From"" log

My coinbase exchange BTC receiving address is 1 on the ""To"" log. 

I'm posting because, I wanted to send 5 dollars worth of BTC to Coinbase exchange through my Coinbase wallet. So when I initiated the transaction through CBW and sent 5 dollars to the exchange, it worked as it should've (batch sending to addresses for testing)

But all of a sudden I check my phantom and it says it sent .1 BTC (my entire sum) to a random address (2 on the ""To"" log) I have never seen before, AND it sent the 5 dollars to the exchange, as seen in the photo above. 

HOWEVER, I check my CBW and all my bitcoin is still there and the original 5 dollar transaction to the exchange went through. 

All that is left on my phantom is .008 bitcoin (which i had recently received as a gift) - so whats left is a recent transaction. 

But my CBW has all of the bitcoin + the recent gift of .008 

I have no idea what that wallet phantom sent ""fake"" btc to is, and I dont know why it did that and if my BTC is still safe in my CBW? 



TLDR: Phantom sent all of my BTC to an address I have never seen before even though all of my BTC is still in my CBW. 

Maybe it is my address somewhere that i missed but I really cant find it. 

Appreciate the insight, I'm semi new to crpyto, only a year in, if this is normal or something I am unaware.

2024-12-04 19:46:03,"The more I understand Bitcoin, the more comfortable I get.","Over the past month, I’ve been diving deep into understanding fiat currency, inflation, deflation, and Jeff Booth’s deflation thesis. I’ve consumed so much material, especially from Saifedean Ammous, that I’ve probably spent over 100–200 hours on it. It’s funny because when I look at my Bitcoin purchases, I can see a pattern—I tend to buy more every time something profound clicks for me in a podcast or a book. This whole journey has been life-changing, but Bitcoin isn’t something you go around preaching. It finds you when you’re ready. Everyone buys Bitcoin at the price they deserve. 

The thing is, this isn’t just about Bitcoin. It’s about finding a way out of the inflationary system that’s constantly eroding our purchasing power, time, and effort. Money is really just a representation of our time and energy, and by putting it into Bitcoin, you’re protecting it from being devalued over time.

We all sense that something is wrong with the world. The rich keep getting richer, and technological advancements, which should be making working hours shorters, life easier and goods cheaper, aren’t improving things for most people. Essentials like homes shouldn’t be treated as speculative investments—they should just serve their purpose. What’s the point of a billionaire owning 25 empty houses while most people can’t afford one? It’s frustrating until you realize that using something like Bitcoin could help change that, making homes more affordable by anchoring their value to utility rather than speculation.

Right now, I’m reading Fiat Food by Matthew Lysiak, and it’s putting into words ideas I’ve felt for a long time but couldn’t articulate. It’s like all the puzzle pieces are finally coming together. The more I learn about Bitcoin, the more confident I feel. It’s unhackable, uncontrollable, and the deeper you go, the more revolutionary it seems. Have a long-term perspective. Keep a small fiat stash for emergencies. Don't be stupid and speculate on Shitcoins. Be patient. And keep learning.

2024-12-04 16:21:24,Most secure method to port forward 8333 to my Windows based Bitcoin full node,"Finally decided to set up a Bitcoin node and support the network!

 //////////// Background ////////////

I have a spare Windows laptop which I've downloaded & installed Bitcoin Core software on. This is a spare system I have with the explicit use to run 24/7/365 as a node.

Synced the full blockchain and then noticed that my node was only producing outbound connections. I then discovered that there's such a thing as a full node, which also allows for inbound connections - learning as I go :)

After fiddling with port forwarding on my router, I worked out my ISP utilizes CGNAT, so I had to set up a static IP with my ISP to allow for port forwarding.

So, jumped through that hoop, forwarded port 8333 to my node on my router, opened port 8333 on the node's firewall (to the Bitcoin Core software), and finally getting inbound connections.

Now my useless backstory is out of the way. I'd like some input on the security of port forwarding please, namely. . . 

 //////////// Security Implications ////////////

I understand that broadcasting my IP enables location tracking. It looks like the geolocation of my static IP actually points to the ISPs location, not mine; and my actual location (major city) is congested enough that I \*doubt\* someone could locate me precisely, so a minor concern for me but one to be aware of.

What I'm more concerned with is the direct security implications of having an \*open\* inbound port on my node, and how to mitigate any risks here.

As I understand it with regards to a firewall, outbound rules allow in and out communication over the internet as long as the original connection originates from your PC e.g. it will allow an inbound response (via the original channel) if it starts the convo. Outbound connections are \*safer\*; as long as the software your running isn't malicious / doesn't connect to a malicious source.

Inbound rules by contrast allow unsolicited connections e.g. any rando can talk to your PC from the internet, and your PC will talk back. This is why inbound rules are so important. Enabling insecure inbound connections could allow malicious actors to talk to directly to your PC.

Usually your firewall, router, ISP are all designed to ensure that any inbound (and outbound) connections are legitimate and the connections are only talking to the app / program /PC they're supposed to talk to.

This is why port forwarding is \*dangerous\*, as your essentially punching a hole through all those layers of security and allowing \*anyone\* to talk directly to your PC; in the case of my node on port 8333.

I noticed by default (and this seems like a massive security flaw) on windows firewall it appears to allow inbound connections across ALL ports on the majority of apps/programs. 

If I understand this correctly, now that my port 8333 is forwarded & open, it means an actor could send requests on port 8333 to example: ""Epson Print Manager"", so long as that software is running in the background, and windows firewall has that software set to allow inbound connections on all ports. Therefore someone could attempt to have that software execute malicious code, or return data/information etc.

Ultimately, this is why port forwarding = security vulnerability. Port forwarding is opening your front door, and we need to make sure that all the internal rooms are locked, except the bitcoin core room!

So. . .  

 //////////// Mitigation ////////////

What can / should I do to mitigate any risks associated with port forwarding (assuming that the Bitcoin Core software itself has no security flaws).

I have so far:

* Removed any software, including various bits of Windows bloat that are unneeded on the system.
* Ensured that all other pieces of software / drivers are updated and kept up to date.
* Disabled all firewall rules that allow inbound connections except for port 8333 specifically on the Bitcoin Core software. Hilariously, noticed zero issues from doing this. . . so why so much software allows for inbound connections on all ports I don't know.

I realize that there are other (potentially safer) ways of setting up a full node, but I'm specifically interested in this way for now :)",0,4,TansySalad,Bitcoin

2024-12-04 12:10:44,"I use lightning regularly, let's clear up some FUD","I've been using lightning for around a year now and I've read lots of incorrect or outdated information about it online. It's been a very smooth experience for me, and I want to share what I've learned.

**TLDR**: Using lightning with a custodial wallet (strike, cash app, etc) is as easy as using venmo. Transactions happen instantly and cost pennies, often under a single cent. Using it with a non-custodial wallet is *slightly* more complicated but well within the ability of the average person as nearly all the complexity has been abstracted away. Lightning scales really well.

# Background:

**Lightning is a scaling layer for Bitcoin** that enables you to make transactions off-chain with security being provided by the base chain. Transactions confirm in under a second and the fees measure in pennies. In fact, by quantity of transactions, lightning is where the majority of Bitcoin transactions are taking place. There are millions every month.

A fundamental problem with blockchain is that space in the blockchain is limited. If you increase the block size (number of transactions per block) or add smart contracts, the size of the chain increases. This means you need more powerful hardware and network connection to run a full node, which increases centralization. Bitcoin, at every turn, has chosen to pursue decentralization, but at the expense of higher chain fees since the limited space increases the competition for the available slots. This is why you can run a Bitcoin node on a 10 year old laptop with a 500GB hard drive but you can't run a node for other cryptos unless you have a server and a fiber connection.

Lightning was designed to enable fast off-chain transactions with much lower fees, and it does that.

# How to use:

To use lightning, you need a wallet which supports it. You can use a custodial or non-custodial wallet.

Custodial wallets mean somebody else holds the keys/funds and you trust them to hold onto them. ""Not your keys, not your coins"" as they say. Custodial wallets are also a popular choice for buying/selling BTC since they can often connect to your bank account. Popular custodial wallets for Bitcoin lightning are Strike, Cash App, and Wallet of Satoshi. I highly suggest strike. **Using a custodial wallet with lightning is as easy as using Venmo.** If you have Cash App, you already have a lightning wallet on your phone.

Non-custodial wallets mean you hold the key, which gives you massively greater control and privacy. But with great power comes great responsibility: If you don't write down the seed phrase it gives you and the device with your wallet dies, you will lose your key and your funds.   
  
Popular non-custodial wallets for lightning are:

\- Phoenix (mobile, non-US only, my #1 suggestion for new users)  
\- Zeus (mobile, powerful, slightly harder to use than Phoenix but my #1 pick for any US users)   
\- Electrum (desktop), I haven't used the lightning feature on it, but Electrum is a solid wallet.

Note: an on-chain tx is required to move any of your existing Bitcoin into lightning. Unless you bought your BTC and store it in a custodial wallet or exchange that supports lightning.

# Myths:

**""Lightning requires you to be constantly re-balancing channels""**

* If you use a custodial wallet, you don't even have to know what a channel is, your wallet provider handles all of this. For non-custodial wallets like Phoenix, this is mostly abstracted.
* For non-custodial wallets like Phoenix, *most* of this is abstracted away for you.
   * You never need to worry about ""balance"", just that you have enough ""inbound liquidity"" to receive a transaction. Think of transactions like water and your ""liquidity"" as the size of your bucket. Pouring out water (sending BTC to others) opens up room in your bucket called ""inbound liquidity:. Receiving BTC puts water back in the bucket.
   * If you open a $50 lightning channel and then send $25 of BTC to somebody over lightning, you have freed up enough room to *receive* $25 over lightning.
   * If you receive a payment and don't have enough ""inbound liquidity"", an on-chain tx will be made which incurs an on-chain fee. Some wallets like Phoenix allow you to rent liquidity for very cheap to avoid these fees.
   * Most people receive their paycheck and then spend most of it, if you follow this pattern, your channels will stay ""balanced"".
   * Some background on channels: in lightning, you make a ""channel"" by locking up some BTC. If you lock up 1BTC in a channel, you can send up to 1BTC to anybody else via lightning. You can have basically an infinite number of transactions in a channel. Every time you send or receive BTC in a lightning channel, the ""balance"" of the channel is updated ie how much of the BTC in the channel belongs to you vs the other person you opened it with. When you send BTC, you open up ""channel capacity"" called ""inbound liquidity"" for somebody to send you BTC over lightning. If you don't have incoming channel capacity and somebody wants to send you BTC, you will need to do an on-chain tx to create it. It works this way to ensure security.
   * Savvy lightning wallet users follow the pattern of establish channel -> swap out. For example, you use $100 worth of BTC to establish a channel. You then send that $100 of BTC to a swap service like BOLTZ, which sends it right back to you on-chain. You pay the cost of 2 on-chain transactions (plus a small fee around 1%) and you now have a $100 lightning channel which can receive up to $100 of BTC. Basically, if you are consistantly receiving more BTC than you are sending, you occasionally batch up some BTC and either yourself or via a swap-out service, you ""send"" that BTC over lightning and ""receive"" it back on main chain.

**""Funds are easy to steal on lightning and you have to monitor everything""**

* Attacks in the wild are incredibly rare because every incentive is aligned against the attacker. I have literally never heard of one happening.
* If you use a custodial wallet, you don't have to monitor anything and your funds are safe if you trust your custodian.
* If you use a non-custodial wallet, you don't have to worry about this either. Phoenix, for example, automatically uses their watchtower service. As long as your device can connect to the internet every few days, you are fine here.
* The main attack watchtowers prevent against (and really the only attack possible in lightning) is for somebody to ""force close"" your channel and broadcast an ""old"" channel state on main chain which assigns the wrong amount of BTC to you. If you watch main chain, you can dispute this state they published, get the correct amount of BTC assigned to you, plus a penalty which is charged to the attacker.
* Lightning is great for everyday spending. If you have significant funds, on-chain txes and cold storage/multi-sig are best.

**""You have to make a channel for everybody you transact with""**

False. Once you have a channel with *anybody* you can use that channel to route payments to anybody else on lightning.

**""You have to keep manual backups of your channel state or you can lose your funds!""**

This is true, but this is usually automated and built into the app. With Phoenix or Zeus, for example, so long as you have your seed phrase you can install Phoenix on a new phone and automatically retrieve the backups made of your chain state since Phoenix's developer keeps the backups.

With custodial wallets, they do this automatically so you just have to remember your username/password.

**""Lightning doesn't scale""**

* Lightning scales very well. Once you create a channel, you can have essentially an infinite amount of transactions in it, all of which occur off-chain. There is enough chain space to make lightning channels for billions of people.
* This provides enough capacity for significant growth in Bitcoin's adoption
* A single on-chain tx can make a single channel. There are proposals in the works to make multiple channels with a single tx (channel factories) and other L2s like Ark and Fedimint which extend/complement lightning.

**""Sure fees are low now, but as more people use it, fees will get high!""**

No. The reason fees increase on main chain is because you have limited space and you must pay miners for that space. You have to compete for that space. That isn't true with lightning. A lightning channel, once opened with a single on-chain tx, can host millions or billions of transactions. The cost to route these transactions is extremely small from a computation standpoint, there is no mining required. Space is not limited, so competition for space doesn't drive high fees.

**""Lightning is centralized""**

Wrong.

* Lightning uses the security of Bitcoin's L1 to secure transactions.
* Transactions are routed through a network of lightning routing nodes, there's currently [at least 41,000 of them](https://1ml.com/statistics), you can run one on a Raspberry Pi.
* Routing nodes can't rug you or steal your funds. You don't have to trust those nodes to secure your BTC, that is secured by L1.",9,6,makeasnek,Bitcoin

2024-12-04 13:04:11,Notes on mining at home and why it (still) matters,"The idea of running a bitcoin miner at home may seem like a thing of the past, but it should not be disregarded.

The decentralization of the hashrate is more important than ever. As the  Overton window shifts from institutional adoption to nation state strategic reserves, we as bitcoiners must not surrender control of bitcoin to anyone who may seek to control it. Here are some interesting numbers for you to consider:

As of writing the hashrate is about 805 EH/s

The humble Bitaxe Gamma, an affordable and open source mining device has a hashrate of 1,2 TH/s.

That means that a single Bitaxe Gamma can represent 0.00000015% of the total bitcoin hashrate.

In other words, if everyone on this sub got just a single Bitaxe Gamma, they would produce 1.11% of the hashrate. That may not sound like a lot to you, but that is an incredible amount of computing power that works to verify and validate the most secure network in the world.

So running a small miner at home will not make you rich, but it would do it's part in keeping bitcoin free and permissionless. Plus you get a few KYC free sats every now and then ;)",17,22,v46ab0nd,Bitcoin

2024-12-04 03:03:20,Liquidate IRA,"I bought a small amount of Bitcoin back in 2021 on a whim knowing hardly anything about it and not expecting much.  I watched it quickly drop in price by about a half and went on with my life not selling but also not paying much attention.  Lately, after seeing the rise, I've done much more research.  While I have much more to learn I believe in the philosophy and the potential of Bitcoin.

I've added to my position and have about 1/3 of a coin now.  I'd love to buy more but most of my assets are tied up in an IRA.  It appears as though I could move the funds into a ""Crypto IRA"" or a Self-Directed IRA where I would have the ability to buy Bitcoin; however, this would defeat the purpose of having self-custody.

For this reason, I've considered liquidating the IRA or at least a portion of it, but I'm having a hard time justifying paying the taxes and penalties that I would incur.  I know many of you will say that I don't truly understand Bitcoin or I don't have enough faith in it.  

You're probably right, but each of us has to make our own decision based upon our circumstances and our beliefs.  I'm currently about 10 years from retirement which will be a decent but modest retirement which I'm fine with.  If I liquidate this and things don't work out, retirement will be much more difficult.  My main goal in considering this is that I want to protect what I have from hyper-inflation and more importantly have something for my two children as I do believe Bitcoin will be very valuable in 15-20 years.

I've been trying to do some research on multisigs, and I feel like I'm ready to take the next step. I am convinced that multisig is the way to go with BTC self custody, but there's a few questions that still bother me:

1: Do I really need 24 word seeds with multisig? Like isn't 2 of 3 with all seeds being 12 words strong enough for at least few generations into the future against brute force attacks?  
2: Do I really need something like Blockstream Jade or Coldcard? Like can't I just generate all 3 seeds on an off-line electrum wallet on a PC with bluetooth & internet disabled on BIOS, while using a TailsOS on USB?

The biggest annoyance for me is the 12 vs 24 word. Everyone says 12 is enough, but some say 24 is even better. But does 24 words really matter in a multisig setup? ",1,7,ImpossibleCoffee91,Bitcoin
2024-12-04 00:50:32,Supply and Demand Discussion ,"Hey all, 

So with 100K coming around the corner and a likely rally into the new year, I was wondering if we could have a discussion about supply and demand.   
  
It seems that Bitcoin's price increase is largely determined by adoption and people investing to keep the volume high enough to reach a break out. With governments coming into the Bitcoin sphere, it seems that the volatility of Bitcoin could come down to governments selling off a significant portion of their Bitcoin all at once. If they hold the mentality that Bitcoin is a store of value, it seems that the support levels for Bitcoin may continue higher. I guess what I am trying to understand is, how is Bitcoin's price effected by other variables outside of increased volume? with prices getting higher, Bitcoin sentiment may reflect a price that is too expensive to enter, and with Bitcoin likely moving into diminishing returns over the years, how could expense be a factor that reduce ones willingness to enter the market? With DCA strategies it is likely that the market will continue to go higher over the long term, however larger moves seem to be in the hands of larger bodies who are investing a significant amount into the market at once. Sometimes I find it hard to see beyond the view of fresh buyers are ultimately pushing the returns of earlier ones.   
  
I understand this is a trading mentality which misses the point of Bitcoin's ethos, however what is to say that the recent adoption is pushing Bitcoin away from something that is effected by government hands when they're leveraging such huge positions which could be sold at any point?

2024-12-03 22:12:08,Anyone else taking a more cautious approach with Bitcoin?,"Is the Bitcoin community mostly split between people who are all in and those who are all out? I’m taking a more conservative route, with about fifteen percent of my portfolio in Bitcoin. I guess I’m coming from the mindset of traditional, balanced investing—diversifying, staying cautious, and thinking long-term—but still seeing the potential in Bitcoin.

I think it’s a good store of value, especially as a hedge against inflation. But with the price near one hundred thousand, it feels like a lot of the current value is driven by speculation. Sure, there’s adoption with things like the Lightning Network and El Salvador using it as legal tender, but it’s nowhere near the scale I expected by now. It still feels like Bitcoin isn’t quite living up to its potential in terms of real-world use.

Also, how long until governments get on board? I imagine it could take decades, especially with current leaders who don’t seem to trust it. So, for now, I’m comfortable with my modest position, while keeping an eye on where it all goes.

One thing I keep wondering is whether the logic we use for traditional investments, like balancing risk and growth, should still apply to Bitcoin. It’s clearly a new kind of asset, but doesn’t some of that cautious investing logic still make sense, even in this new space?

Anyone else out there taking a similar cautious but optimistic approach? Or am I overthinking it? Curious to hear how others are seeing Bitcoin’s role in a portfolio.",0,22,Glittering_Fish_2296,Bitcoin

It’s to the point where I have heard someone say you might be more likely to win the lottery than find the stock that has an enormous payout. So why do people keep investing in them when they’re very likely throwing away money when they do so, are they stupid?

Over the years, I’ve learned that while Bitcoin’s value trends upward over the long term, the journey is never a straight line, and that's how I been feeling when it should have been a rollercoaster of emotions!

Looking at the charts yesterday as BTC hit $100k, I noticed there have been about five corrections of around 20% each as we gained the momentum, with one post-halving correction just under 35%. Comparing this to previous cycles, most pullbacks have historically been in the 20-35% range, though we’ve also seen major pullbacks of 35-50%.

Watching Bitcoin make history by crossing $100k, it seemed to struggle a bit, and just a few hours ago when researching facts for this post, BTC ironically dropped by 10%. However, it quickly found support at $96.5k.

When analyzing altcoins, the majority are up anywhere from 2x to 100x, with most not experiencing major pullbacks (apart from XRP and a few exceptions).

Another key observation: there’s currently a massive imbalance in long vs. short contracts. Despite this, I haven’t seen many liquidation articles recently, which used to be quite common with Bitcoin. For example, a long squeeze now could potentially liquidate about $200M worth of contracts.

Looking for Advice: Should I Buy Stellar Lumens (XLM)?

Hi everyone,
I’ve been diving into the crypto space recently and came across Stellar Lumens (XLM). It seems like an interesting project, especially with its focus on facilitating cross-border payments efficiently and its partnerships with big names like MoneyGram. From what I’ve read, Stellar aims to make global transactions faster and cheaper, which feels like a strong use case.

That said, the crypto market is highly volatile, and I want to make an informed decision before investing. I’m curious to know if others see XLM as a solid long-term investment or if it’s more of a speculative play right now.

For those familiar with Stellar Lumens:

Do you believe it has strong growth potential in the coming years?

Are there specific risks or challenges the project faces that I should know about?

Is now a good time to buy, or are there better opportunities in the crypto space?


I’d really appreciate any insights, advice, or experiences you’re willing to share. I’m trying to weigh the pros and cons before making a move. Thanks in advance for your help!

2024-12-05 21:37:37,Telcoin,"Just heard about this coin two days ago from my brother due to a public hearing that was held today and rushed to buy the news. This is my first crypto purchase and I know I should’ve done more research but he made a mill off this xrp bull run so I figured he knows a thing or two about up and coming projects. So in FOMO I bought in around .0067 (I know what it was a month ago so no need to bash lol). 

From what I gathered they have two weeks to give a written description on how they’re a “bank”. That got me wondering what is the purpose of a physical building for digital assets? Can anyone clarify further what benefit or pitch point there is for this? I have asked him and all I get is “I’m sure they have it figured out” but that’s a non answer for me. I’m down to hear both sides on the yay or nay or the coin even though I already put some money in (currently down). Hopefully someone out there can make it make sense.

2024-12-05 21:33:36,First Bull Run with Deflationary ETH,"We all know how BTC and ETH historically perform during Bull Runs. BTC leads the charge, tops out, then ETH pumps. But what's different this time?

**ETH Is now deflationary, while BTC remains inflationary**

Historically, ETH has had a **much** higher inflation rate than BTC, leading to lower price appreciation during bull runs due to greater increase to supply and lack of scarcity. 

Remember price is a function of **supply and demand** which is why halving events correlate with price appreciation.


Dec 2017:

BTC Inflation Rate: 4.39%

ETH Inflation Rate: 10.59%

Inflation Margin (difference): **6.20% in BTCs favor**



Dec 2021:

BTC Inflation Rate: 1.86%

ETH Inflation Rate: 5.20%

Inflation Margin (difference): **3.34% in BTCs favor**




Dec 2024:

BTC Inflation Rate: 0.87% 

ETH Inflation Rate: **-0.03% (Average since merge)**

Inflation Margin (difference): **0.9% in ETHs favor**





**Conclusion: If ETH demand preforms the way it historically does relative to BTC, price appreciation relative to BTC should be greater this bull run, as this is the first bull run where BTCs supply will be increasing faster than ETHs.**

Consider that for buyers relying on ETFs for crypto exposure, ETH is their only real exposure to 'alt season'.

2024-12-05 19:45:18,Q1 2025 Crash?,"I've noticed a lot of people talking about cashing out and a potential crypto crash in early 2025. Historically, these crashes often happen on the Q4 every 4 years. It's strange to see so many people expecting a crash in April/May, when the usual pattern is more towards the end of the year. 

These people are not talking about a market correction or one or two red months, they are convinced that the cycle will end 2 quarters before the usual. Why is that??

2013 peak was in the 4th of december, 2017 was on december 16th and 2021 was on november 8th.

Honestly, It makes no sense to me to see the end of the bull run in 3-4 months when It has barely started, Bitcoin reached 100k and have been dominant. ETH and Alts haven't even pumped yet! Are these just bears or is there something concrete behind this ideas?

I plan to cash out during early Q3 2025, new investors should be providing plenty of exit liquidity till october 2025.

2024-12-05 19:05:01,Defi Leveraging the rise and crash of the crypto market,"I watched a really great video on coin beau youtube channel, explaining how defi leveraging affects alt coin market prices and how they affect the rise and crash of price action. What many people don't know is whales use bitcoin as collateral so they can buy up alt coins, when bitcoins keep going up, there is more money to buy up alt coins, but when bitcoin crashes, that collateral is less. Which causes the price of alt coins to start tanking. Tanking VERY fast.

I know most of the people here don't probably know or give two shits about this, only focus on wen their coin MOON and LAMBO. But it's a good cautionary tale, and a look at what the whales are exactly doing behind the curtain. I placed the link below if you want to watch it.  The bigger they are, the harder they fall. This holds very true for any market, this crypto run is going to be epic, but it's going to be a freakin epic crash too.

Like I said i know nothing about CC but since the world is heading in this direction, I figured now is a good time to start. I'll be buying BTC every week until I know how to actually use it.

I'd like to simply divest myself of these holdings, but that seems to involve:

1. Sending the coins from the CEX to a hot wallet. (Incurs a fee).
2. Swapping the coins in the wallet to something more usable. (Incurs massive Eth gas fees.)
3. Send the newly swapped coins back to the CEX. (Incurs another fee.)

It's step 2 that I'm stuck on.  The holdings I have in each coin range from $40 to $80, and the gas fees to swap each are something like $30 to $50.

This seems a bit ridiculous.  At the end of this process my $500 will be $100 if I'm lucky.

Is there a better / cheaper way to divest these coins?

Ideally I'd hope to get at least $400 out of the $500 that they are worth.

2024-12-05 07:53:48,Nervos to build Layer 2 on Doge,"Announcing in the previous week, Nervos is working on bringing its layer 2 protocol RGB++ to Dogecoin. With initial plans for a memecoin launchpad built on DOGE. With also bringing the possibilities associated with DOGE now being connected to BTC through RGB++

RGB++ has been receiving a lot of interest recently from both the Bitcoin and Asian crypto communities after having first being built for Bitcoin and its very novel approach of 'Isomorphic binding' which requires no actual bridge to the other chain but rather, mapping 2 chains along side each other.

**Quote from recent Techflow article:**

>It is reported that RGB++ will support the $Doge chain in the next step, and will launch the Meme launchpad on the Doge chain after the launch of BTC Meme launchpad. At the same time, he also said that the lightning network is the strategic direction of CKB's long-term layout, which will greatly increase the competitive advantage of the RGB++ protocol. It is worth noting that at present, many teams are not only focusing on the development of the protocol itself, but also promoting the compatibility of their protocols with lightning networks, such as Taproot Assets and RGB. Up to now, RGB++ ecological Meme leading coin SEAL has risen by 50% in 24 hours, and CKB has risen by 12%.

**INTRODUCTION TO RGB++**

RGB++ is an extension protocol based on RGB, utilizing single-use seals and client-side validation technology to manage state changes and transaction verification. It maps UTXOs to Nervos CKB Cells via isomorphic bindings and uses script constraints on the CKB and the other chain to verify the correctness of state computation and the validity of ownership changes.

RGB++ addresses the technical challenges faced by the original RGB protocol in practical implementation and provides more possibilities, such as blockchain-enhanced client validation, transaction folding, shared states with ownerless contracts, and non-interactive transfers. It brings Turing-complete contract extensions and performance enhancements to the other chain without the need for cross-chain transfers or compromising security.

2024-12-05 07:24:54,Why is buying crypto and sending it to cold storage SUCH A HASSLE?,"I am developing a diversified portfolio of coins for long term holding, investing a percentage of my paycheck into buying the coins.

I have a cold storage wallet I want to transfer my coins to after I make my purchase. Never in my life have I been so infuriated at how seemingly difficult such a simple desire is.

I've bounced between Coinbase, Kraken, Robinhood and other places to figure out where the heck is going to be the best place to buy my coins and then transfer them. The simple answer? There isn't one place that makes this easy.

Buy minimums. Transfer minimums. Transfer out fees. Buy fees.

Like, I get it, I understand paying a fee. Maybe I'm just wanting things to be oversimplified. **But where can I go to buy and transfer coins easily without tons of restricting factors?**

Robinhood wants me to transfer stuff to another place first because cold storage doesn't have a memo. Coinbase wants to overcharge me, and has ridiculous minimums. Kraken won't connect to my checking account for some reason, but it *will* connect to my emergency savings account (?!)

Finally, and this is a real dream I guess, I'd love if I could just throw all my money at a single location, then it automagically buys my desired percentages of each coin, then I can handle the manual transfers to my cold storage.

Is any of this possible or am I dreaming?

It seems that Paul Atkins is now chosen to lead the SEC.

We don't know yet and will find out very soon how this will affect the cryptomarket for better or worse (I'm holding my beer here since before being SEC chair, Garry Gensler was also very much crypto supportive (and he turned villain since then).

Neverthelss, it seems that the upcoming SEC chair Paul Atkins was ball deep in cryptoverse.

Apparently there's market FOMO (and may not end well) when a lot of people are pouring hard-earned money into RSR, the token of Reserve Rights Foundation. So I'm just curious if you know anything about this protocol and its token? It seems to be a platform to issue stablecoin. But I have no ideas how it actually works (and is it like Terra/Luna or so.

Theoretically if Kusama used all it's cores, then the TPS could be as high as 560k TPS. This officially makes Kusama the fastest chain in the space.

I’m looking for any website that has that sort of information

2024-12-04 16:46:00,"For those investing in L2s, what are your thoughts on Polygon (not an L2 yet but will be) compared to the crowd?","I’ve been an investor. I’m bullish the Agglayer in concept but understand it takes a lot to onboard everyone. Also no guarantees it becomes THE interop solution like they envision.

Polygon POS is pretty popular and set to become a zkevm validium at some point and Polygons zkevm rollup is out but doesn’t seem like many people use it, is that right? I’m just curious what people think about it as an investment. I could put my money elsewhere. I don’t actually use crypto everyday so I don’t have a firsthand understanding of what makes these chains successful. Not sure polygon pos switching to L2 will really change anything in terms of money coming in but not really sure how it works.

Arbitrum just hit 20 billion TVL, which is a record, so I don’t see why people wouldn’t invest there. Doesn’t it seem obvious to invest here, or am I missing something? It has the highest TVL of any layer 2 by a long shot. But I don’t always understand what makes these coins move (besides memes in the case of Solana lol). What is driving this activity on arbitrum anyhow?

Also Optimism’s TVL is around 9 billion. I believe polygon POS is around 4-5 billion. 

I know arbitrum and optimism aren’t ZK rollups, which are apparently the future, but that doesn’t mean it can’t just switch its technology eventually, and when it does, I don’t see why it can’t overtake polygon in market cap, right? Unless that’s not how it works? Polygon does have the agglayer though.

What do people think? I know I’m missing something about my assessment which is why I’m here. I could invest in both I guess but just curious and trying to understand the future of crypto! 

I know there’s superchain too so if people wanna talk about that in this discussion would be happy to hear it

2024-12-04 16:43:26,Withdrawal Fiat from Exchanges (Crypto dot com not an option)...,"So when I first got into Crypto I looked for an exchange where the fiat wallet would have an account number and a routing number. The first one I found was with Crypto Dot Com and I was like this is great. I can set up the fiat wallet as an external account on my primary bank and be insulated from having to put my primary account information out there depending on them to keep it safe.

Flash forward to recently and while the ACH from my bank to CDC works perfectly fine when I tried to ACH from CDC (fiat wallet) to my bank it was rejected by CDC and unauthorized. After getting the run around for days it was finally revealed to me that the only way to get Fiat from CDC is to use PLAID.  Now lets assume they have cleaned up their act but they still require you to provide your logon credentials to your bank to set up the transfer between CDC (fiat wallet) and my primary bank, this seem sketchy to me but maybe I am just being old.

So anyone know of an exchange that does have ACH access both ways so I dont have to use PLAID? If so I figure I will buy a stable coin move it to that exchange cash out and ACH back to my primary account.",0,3,pt109_66,CryptoCurrency

I remember discovering Dogecoin back in early 2014 when $500 would buy you a million, and my friend tried to explain to me (patiently) how that was just a fad and if i really wanted to be a millionaire one day I needed to read some 'Boglehead books' and learn about ETFs and mutual funds.  

When i tried to tell my coworkers about bitcoin they all patiently explained to me (how an adult might explain to a child) that Bitcoin wasn't actually worth anything and it wasn't ""backed by anything"".  

I was excited to meet my girlfriend's friend's boyfriend once because i heard he was into finance.  He basically spent the entire dinner cracking jokes at my expense and explaining how little i understood money.  

When i tried to tell my investment buddy about Monero, and begged him to get into it at 30 cents, he thought it was stupid and said he thought Visa was a better investment for money.  Then when Monero went to $2 each and i continued to rant to him his reaction was ""nice, you sold it all right?"".  Then when it went to $12 each he legit got mad at me that I wouldn't sell it.  By the time it was $50 each he stopped talking to me.  

If you've been in crypto for more than 10 years, it's been an exhausting and frustrating experience.

I have also added a changelog page for things I am working on with the site. I do want to introduce some form of community voting on including requested indicators. However, those requested indicators need some form of proof that they are valuable and meaningful when it comes to the crypto market.

2024-12-04 10:54:16,After years NEO‘s founder is suddenly speaking speaking up. Why? Let‘s take a look at the current stake of NEO. ,"NEO: The Sleeping Giant Poised for a Crypto Revolution

In the volatile yet promising world of cryptocurrency, a few projects stand out as pioneers, visionaries, and innovators. Among these, NEO, often dubbed the “Ethereum of China,” is gearing up for an explosive resurgence. While the broader market may have seen its fair share of ups and downs, NEO is quietly positioning itself to emerge as one of the most dominant blockchain platforms in the world.

The Foundation: Why NEO Is Special

NEO’s foundation is built on unique principles that set it apart from the hundreds of blockchain projects in the market today. Known for its dual-token model (NEO and GAS) and a robust dBFT (delegated Byzantine Fault Tolerance) consensus mechanism, NEO combines efficiency, scalability, and decentralization in a way few platforms can rival. It was among the first blockchains to introduce digital identity integration, ensuring compliance with regulations while maintaining privacy—making it a prime candidate for mass adoption.

But the true strength of NEO lies in its developer-friendly ecosystem. Unlike other platforms, NEO supports multiple programming languages, such as Python, Java, and C#, making it highly accessible to a broader developer community. This is crucial in a world where Web3 solutions and decentralized applications (dApps) are becoming mainstream.

The Bullish Case for NEO

1. Regulation-Friendly Blockchain for the New Era

NEO’s emphasis on compliance and regulation-friendly technology makes it a unique player in the blockchain space. As governments around the globe implement stricter regulations, platforms that integrate legal compliance without sacrificing decentralization will be the ones that thrive. NEO’s built-in digital identity tools make it well-suited for large-scale enterprise adoption and government collaborations.

2. China’s Crypto Renaissance

While China has had a tumultuous relationship with cryptocurrency, its government is heavily investing in blockchain technology. With NEO being one of the most prominent blockchain projects to originate from China, it stands to benefit immensely from the nation’s push for blockchain innovation. The upcoming integration with China’s Blockchain Service Network (BSN) could catapult NEO into the global spotlight as the preferred blockchain platform in one of the world’s largest economies.

3. NEO 3.0: The Game-Changer

The recent release of NEO 3.0 is a game-changer. This upgrade makes NEO faster, more secure, and more developer-friendly. Key features include:
	•	Improved scalability: With the ability to process thousands of transactions per second, NEO is poised to handle mass adoption.
	•	Cross-chain interoperability: NEO’s focus on interoperability makes it a critical player in the multi-chain future.
	•	Enhanced developer tools: NEO’s SDKs and tools now empower developers to build better dApps faster, ensuring rapid ecosystem growth.

4. Explosive Ecosystem Growth

NEO’s ecosystem is rapidly expanding with DeFi, NFTs, and metaverse projects building on the platform. Protocols like Flamingo Finance (a DeFi hub on NEO) and upcoming NFT marketplaces are adding immense utility to the NEO blockchain. As the ecosystem grows, the demand for NEO (the token) and GAS will naturally increase, driving up prices.

5. Scarcity and Staking Rewards

With a capped supply of 100 million tokens, NEO is inherently scarce. Moreover, by holding and staking NEO, investors earn GAS, providing passive income and incentivizing long-term holding. As more users stake their tokens, the circulating supply diminishes, creating a powerful upward price pressure.

Why NEO Could Skyrocket

The crypto market loves a good comeback story, and NEO has all the ingredients to be the star of the next bull run:
	1.	Strong Fundamentals: Unlike many speculative projects, NEO has a solid technical foundation.
	2.	Institutional Interest: NEO’s regulatory compliance and enterprise-friendly features make it attractive for institutions.
	3.	Undervalued Market Position: Currently trading far below its all-time high, NEO presents a massive upside potential for investors who see its long-term vision.

Vision 2025: A $1,000 NEO?

Imagine a world where NEO becomes the backbone of smart economies across Asia, Europe, and beyond. As blockchain adoption accelerates, NEO could easily surpass its previous all-time high of $196 and head into four-digit territory. With DeFi, NFTs, and enterprise blockchain solutions converging on NEO’s ecosystem, a $1,000 price target is not just optimistic—it’s achievable.

Final Thoughts

NEO is more than just a cryptocurrency; it’s a platform for the future of smart economies. With the launch of NEO 3.0, strategic positioning in Asia, and a growing ecosystem of real-world applications, NEO is primed for explosive growth. The crypto market often rewards projects with solid fundamentals, real-world utility, and visionary leadership—qualities NEO embodies.

As the next wave of blockchain adoption unfolds, don’t sleep on NEO. This sleeping giant is about to awaken, and when it does, it could redefine the crypto landscape. The question isn’t whether NEO will succeed—it’s whether you’ll be there to ride the wave.",0,9,schwitaner,CryptoCurrency

I’m sure most of these firms are doing this unless I’m missing something?

Similarly, crypto exchanges should be regulated and required to pay interest on users’ deposits. These exchanges use our fiat currency to grow their businesses, yet they often provide no compensation in return. This is unfair, as they owe us interest just like banks do. In fact, I believe it’s time for a class-action lawsuit to demand that crypto exchanges retroactively compensate users with interest on their deposits. Without regulation, they continue to profit from our funds without accountability, and that needs to change.

I believe stuffs like these sell themselves, it's no secret how communities centered around crypto can offer so much, I've been able to connect with other traders, win exclusive merch, and get access to unique opportunities like staking and discounts. Considering the criteria for getting in, I think it's one of my best decisions this year. At least that's what I tell myself LOL.   
  
That said, are there similar groups? I'd like to know other people experience with things like this, what's the most surprising reason you joined a group, and how did it go?",0,15,minibuddy0,CryptoCurrency

2024-12-04 00:26:33,So I had some XYO (how FOMO begins)…,"XYO was one of my kinda low effort low amount buys a while ago.  It had been slowly dripping downward, so I put it into cardano and started turning green…. until the next day!     

XYO shoots 100% up.   I was shocked, but it was like 200$ that could have turned 400$… so we aren’t talking life changing, But pulling out 200 in profit would be nice.   soo, i laugh it off, but snoop around for other coins and end up spending 300$ on a few coins.   I go to bed.  


Middle of the night, I wake up and XYO dipped like 5%…. I thought, funny if i put 100$, but instead spent another 200$ on other coins.   

That’s not the way I make crypto purchases, that’s the way i shop on amazon drunk at 3am.   


I wake up that morning.   …  XYO 200%!  awfackin come on!!  

I’m on tilt now… trying to figure out what coin is like a degree away from XYO that will do the same thing in a week.   I’m deep in the weeds, dropping 50$ buys on coins that are at their current run peak, barely avoiding ath’s.     

Finally, the fever breaks as chainlink shot up and rebalanced my portfolio and temperament a little.   

Now is not the time to buy anything really unless you believe strongly in the tech, and even then, you could quickly become caught holding a small cold bag thru a long winter.   I’m not sure what’s to come, but weird stuff is happening and it almost had me trading like it’s a poker game.  

tl:dr… if XYO was my entire portfolio and i realized those gains… well, I could buy a nice used, no …. pre-owned certified uh, import.   ",0,16,sirCota,CryptoCurrency

2024-12-03 23:58:43,Let’s talk limit buy orders and exchanges/options,"Lately I’ve been setting some low-ball limit buys hoping to catch a dip. The problem I have is that I have to have the money in my exchange account (in this case Coinbase) instead of being able to just connect it to my checking account. 

I see where it makes sense for the exchange. They need the funds to execute the buy and can’t rely on you to have the money in your personal account or credit card or whatever. Plus they have your money like a bank does and they’re earning off of it while it sits idle. 

But because of this, I can’t set all of the orders I’d like to bc I won’t put that amount of money in the exchange just hoping that some day those orders fill. Plus, its not like the exchange is paying me interest while they hold my funds like my bank will. My personal account would be able to execute all of the orders even if they hit at once so it just makes sense to me to not give up control of my money while I’m waiting for a dip that gets to my number. 

Is there another option I don’t know of? Is there an exchange that doesn’t require a deposit to issue a limit order? Is there just some other nuance I don’t know about, or is the only option to back all orders with matching deposits on the exchanges?",0,5,STNGGRY,CryptoCurrency

Look, I'm not gonna deny that some shady practices exist in this industry, but the documentary is seriously biased. James basically attacks Bitcoin and NFTs purely from an investment angle.

The video's got weak sources and a narrative that's super repetitive—exactly what we see in typical mass media. It's funny how ""tech influencers"" like Marques Brownlee end up backing this kind of content. It just shows how killer video editing and smooth storytelling can blow up on YouTube, even when the research is trash.

The really sad part? This video has over 6 million views. That means tons of people who know nothing about Bitcoin are getting fed this narrative.

So, if you're new to this whole crypto world, I'm gonna point you to an article I wrote on Hackernoon: [The 6M Views Crypto Documentary That Got It Wrong](https://hackernoon.com/the-6m-views-crypto-documentary-that-got-it-wrong).

My piece breaks down the holes in James's arguments. And just to be clear—I'm not trying to sell you on investing in Bitcoin or NFTs. I just want to give you a more realistic take on the industry. The article digs into blockchain technology and its actual value, instead of throwing around investment advice.

2024-12-03 16:16:34,Did anyone listen to Mark Andreessen on Rogans podcast? ,"So Mark and Rogan had a segment where they talked about how AI will affect elections eventually, and it will be hard to tell what’s real and what’s an AI video. Low information voters will get tricked by AI videos, and they won’t spend the time to investigate if it’s real or not. Mark mentioned that one possible way of moving past this problem is that videos and information will have to be registered on a blockchain of some sort, and that will allow people to verify if someone actually said something compared to it being a fake AI video. (I hope I explained that correctly) 

My thought on this is that blockchains will be a valuable thing to have around in an age where it’s hard to tell what’s real and what’s not. 

Are there any current crypto projects that would fit the bill for this sort of thing? Like being able to register and verify videos on a blockchain, so that people could come back and make sure a video is actually real? Does this make sense? ",0,29,CryptoKnightKush,CryptoCurrency

2024-12-03 15:52:37,Remember. You can always sell a portion of your holdings. It doesn’t have to be all or nothing. Make a plan.,"I constantly read people say, “Oh just my luck, I sold all my XRP to go into purple unicorn (or whatever it is) just 6 months ago! I can’t believe I missed out on this. Just my luck!”

Remember. You can always sell a portion of a holding when you hit a price target. You don’t have to liquidate the asset entirely. The key though is to have a plan, otherwise you’ll be second guessing yourself constantly with the daily/weekly pumps and dumps.

My plan? I sell a third of all my assets when the total market cap hits 4 trillion. I sell another third when the total market cap hits 7 trillion. Right now I’m not buying anything unless the total market cap dips below 2 trillion. 

I’m not saying this is a great plan, just what I’m doing. Make sure you have a plan or else you’ll be doing the flip flap trader stuff that will screw you over in the long term.

What I’m realizing more and more with each cycle is that no one really knows what’ll happen with different assets. It’s incredibly hard to pick winners. About a year ago I posted my portfolio and was clowned on. My general strategy? The majority of my holdings are in BTC and ETH. I then have a basket of the big L1s that can handle volume.  I own a total of 26 coins. Alts make up a much smaller % than BTC and ETH. 

For years people have said SOL & ADA are shit, XRP sucks, ALGO is mid, DOGE’s inflation is ridiculous, XLM and LTC are washed. Tbh, I think pretty much all cryptos are stupid including these. But I still bought them because ultimately I don’t know what will play out long term. But I figure that the gains from 1-3 coins will pay for the losses of the rest and it’s worked out so far.

Unless you’re only in BTC, I really hate the “concentration is the way to go bro, otherwise you’ll dilute your gains” perspective. Because how do you know you’re right? Look at EOS or NEO. How do you know that you picked the right winners? Now should be said, how do I know that I picked the 26 correct winners? I don’t. But generally speaking, I’ll model my portfolio after what Grayscale does so that at the least I’m riding the currents of the institutional players.

This includes unused real estate, luxury goods, and digital assets (they used BTC as an example - many times)

This proposal came up during discussions on the 2025 Finance Bill and again they used Bitcoin as an example to illustrate the tax's potential range. The purpose of the tax is to capture wealth from assets that dont contribute to economic productivity

A preliminary vote (EMPHASIS ON PRELIMINARY) on this amendment was held on November 26 where only supporting senators were in the chamber - the vote passed in this setting but it doesnt represent the final say yet.

2024-12-03 13:31:36,Dot-com bubble 2.0?,"""The dot-com bubble (or dot-com boom) was a stock market bubble that ballooned during the late-1990s and peaked on Friday, March 10, 2000. This period of market growth coincided with the widespread adoption of the World Wide Web and the Internet, resulting in a dispensation of available venture capital and the rapid growth of valuations in new dot-com startups. Between 1995 and its peak in March 2000, investments in the NASDAQ composite stock market index rose by 800%, only to fall 78% from its peak by October 2002, giving up all its gains during the bubble.""

The above is from Wikipedia. Just a FYI for those who maybe not be familiar with it. 

I think because crypto is new, many coins are like  dot-com startups. 

When (/if) the bubble pops, the only coins that will be left standing will be bitcoin as a store of wealth, and coins that have established RWA. 

What are your thoughts? If you agree, what coins do you think will be here for the long run?  Like the dot-com companies that survived due to thier RWA and are now thriving.  ",0,19,Tom-_Bombadil,CryptoCurrency

**TLDR;**

* Chainlink has partnered with 21X, an asset manager to launch RWA-based money market funds in Europe.
* Entry into the regulated RWA space in the EU could help Chainlink diversify and increase its revenue.
* Blockchain oracles in Chainlink are paid in LINK, and new adoption will increase demand.
* LINK enjoys being the only major player in the oracle space with others like Supra Oracles and QED being much smaller.
* LINK has formed super bullish charts with a complete rounding bottom pattern and two breakouts at $19.9 and $23.
* Near-term price targets are $33 (in Dec 2024), $53 by March 2025, and $100 by the end of 2025.",7,15,Traditional_Motor_51,CryptoCurrency

2024-12-03 09:09:09,This Is Why I Think Market Cap Doesn't Matter With Crypto.,"Let's use XRP as an example since it's usually the XRP Army that says MC doesn't matter.

XRP has a max supply of 100bn and a circulating supply of about 57bn..In a perfect world, if I wish to calculate MC, that would be `xrp price * circulating supply` and I would get my MC.   
  
Now we do not live in a perfect world, people forget and people die..let's assume that of all the people that own crypto who are forgetful and who have died all collectively owned 7bn XRP, and none of the remember their seed phrase or never had the opportunity to write down the seed phrase in their will before dying...this would mean that all 7bn XRP is ""gone"" forever never to leave the wallets and circulate again. Now I ask, if I wanted to calculate MC, would it make sense (or be accurate) to calculate MC and include the 7bn that's gone forever and never to be in circulation again?.. OF COURSE NOT!..the right thing to do would be to exculde the 7bn because it is technically no longer in circulation.

We have no way of knowing how much XRP is gone forever (except for the burnt XRP that is recorded), which means we will never have a 100% accurate representation of the MC of XRP.

This is why I think it's pointless to care about MC when it comes to crypto, ESPECIALLY when there is no way to track how many coins are lost forever.

[Home Screen](https://preview.redd.it/7hqigik72l4e1.png?width=1689&format=png&auto=webp&s=7cfa401600b5b02f8e7472d19dc82395b05a1e66)

For what I could see this site has a lot of useful information to teach everyone how to build, stake and in general use Polygon ecosystem. However one of the sections that brought my attention more is Polygon Ecosystem section [https://polygon.technology/ecosystem](https://polygon.technology/ecosystem)

[Polygon Ecosystem Screen](https://preview.redd.it/8j4eh9h82l4e1.png?width=1880&format=png&auto=webp&s=e9e412b01866caacd0216011ee7340086c918999)

I believe this kind of sections are really important to bring attention to different projects in the ecosystem and also make it easy to find them and also the legit links to them.

As you can see in the images, the UI is quite beautiful.

In the following image we can see the hot apps in the ecosystem like Quickswap, 1inch, Planet lx (First time I hear about it), Uniswap V3, Galxe, etc.

[Hot dApps](https://preview.redd.it/w02f5as92l4e1.png?width=1405&format=png&auto=webp&s=d12725c0872c1f291ba5a11a3457c0ee10a60c88)

If we go down a bit more we can see a search bar with different options making it easier to navigate and find the different apps registered to appear there.

[dApps searcher](https://preview.redd.it/kc7nwp3b2l4e1.png?width=1453&format=png&auto=webp&s=aa673c9823048be4d1a82e68d3fd606754d0ba97)

Regarding the registering process, it looks that ""anyone"" can do it through an easy button on the top and I believe it is free if you meet the criteria.

To conclude, I believe this kind of ecosystem searchers should be available in all existing L1 sites.

2024-12-03 07:03:22,"NanoGPT (use AI through crypto) update: system prompts, SillyTavern, Binance Pay/Coinbase Wallet, UX, more models, payment stats","Lots of changes since our most recent update!

[NanoGPT update](https://preview.redd.it/7c60t84v0l4e1.png?width=1024&format=png&auto=webp&s=f20c8a3bd22f552a43b7980f94b4c046d3d36804)

# UX improvements:

\- It's now possible to add a **system prompt** (for all models except Claude/Gemini ones)

\- There's a **dark/light mode switch** next to new chat

\- **Export chats** as PDF or Markdown by appending ?export=pdf or =md to the URL

\- ALT + C for new chat, ALT + I for new image (Option C and Option I on Mac)

# New models:

\- **Qwen QwQ 32b** is Alibaba's answer to OpenAI's o1-preview. It ""thinks"", and only starts outputting later.

\- OpenAI and Google released about 4 **new versions of ChatGPT/Gemini**, to constantly overtake each other on the leaderboards (we immediately push their newest version live every time). Google also released LearnLM, a model focused specifically on helping people learn new skills, which of course we added.

\- Alibaba's **Qwen Max, Qwen Large, Qwen Long and Qwen Turbo** have been added, very low prices and up to 10m token context. Almost no other provider offers these models.

\- **Step-2-16k**, another Chinese model, is also pretty much only available through us. It scores extremely well on the LiveBench comparison, and is very popular in China.

\- **Mistral Large** and a *ton* of open-source models got added. These include many Roleplay/Storytelling models (more on that below) and **two ""abliterated"" models**, versions of models that have been finetuned to remove limitations and biases. They're uncensored versions, essentially.

# Cool integrations:

\- **SillyTavern** is an open-source front-end that many people use for roleplaying. We're now natively supported and suddenly have a lot more users that are interested in roleplaying models, hence also the additions.

\- **""battleofcoins.com""** lets you pick crypto, pick models, and have the AIs discuss and debate which one is best over multiple rounds. Very fun implementation, you can pick any selection criteria you want.

# More:

\- We added lots of additional payment methods: **Binance Pay, Coinbase Wallet**, ETH + L2s, and a lot more. This is likely the last additions we did for a while there, since anything else feels like diminishing returns.

\- We released **payment stats** on how much the different crypto were used. I'll add this into a comment because I'm afraid links will get the post removed. 



Also important for many of you: we have a working branch with file uploads. It can take excel files, pdfs, documents etc. We want to release it as soon as possible but it's also a change that needs quite a bit of testing, so we don't want to push it too soon and get people annoyed at how badly it works.

Let's talk about what exactly that would look like. XRP has a circulating supply of 57B. At a price of $100 each that would put the marketcap of XRP at $5.7T. OVER 3X the current marketcap of BTC, and this doesn't even consider the inevitable increase in circulating supply as time passes.

Look I get it, it's fun to dream about 25x (or 250x gains for people talking about XRP to $1,000 - I'm dead serious people are talking about this) but don't let those dreams cause you to make bad investment decisions.

The reality is quite the opposite.   
Requiring stablecoin reserves to be maintained within an EU-based financial institution is far from transparent. Worse still, it effectively hands control of these coins to traditional financial institutions. Given that much of crypto trading relies on stablecoins, this move essentially returns control of the entire ecosystem to these entities—the very antithesis of what cryptocurrencies were designed to achieve.   

For governments, this is a godsend. All the fiat currency that crypto buyers have invested now falls under their control. They can use it to bolster their treasuries or allocate it as they see fit. They will control the reserves, reap the interest, and dictate terms. In doing so, they could even manipulate or crash the crypto markets if it serves their interests.",2,19,sleepyokapi,CryptoCurrency

2024-12-02 16:14:26,Heard of VeChain? (VET),"If you’re skeptical about cryptocurrency, you’re not alone—but let me introduce you to something that stands out in the crypto world: VeChain (VET). Unlike many digital currencies that are speculative or unproven, VeChain has real-world utility and an incredibly solid use case that’s already gaining traction with major corporations across industries.

VeChain isn’t just a digital asset. It’s a blockchain platform that’s revolutionizing supply chain management and business logistics. Through VeChain, businesses can track products in real-time from production to delivery, ensuring authenticity, reducing fraud, and cutting out inefficiencies. Think about it: luxury goods, pharmaceuticals, and food safety—industries where traceability is key. VeChain makes it all possible through its cutting-edge blockchain technology.

One of the most exciting aspects of VeChain is its partnerships. It’s already working with some of the world’s biggest companies, like DHL, PwC, and BMW, integrating blockchain solutions into their operations. These aren’t speculative ventures; they’re real, high-value collaborations that demonstrate VeChain’s proven ability to solve problems and add value on a large scale.

If you’re thinking, “But what about long-term potential?” Here’s where it gets even more compelling. The VeChain ecosystem is powered by a dual token system: VET, the primary token, and VTHO, used for transaction fees. As adoption grows, demand for VET is likely to increase, potentially driving up its value. And with its enterprise focus, VeChain is designed for scalability—an essential factor for staying relevant as blockchain technology evolves.

In a world where transparency, efficiency, and trust are becoming more critical, VeChain isn’t just a trend—it’s a solution that’s already making a tangible impact. It’s not about gambling on price swings; it’s about investing in a technology that’s fundamentally transforming industries.

So, if you’re looking to invest in something that’s not only about potential but is actively delivering real-world value, VeChain could be the opportunity you’ve been waiting for.",0,28,mistaitaly420,CryptoCurrency

The analysis concludes that public permissionless blockchains represent a promising alternative to permissioned platforms, with the potential to reduce dependencies and mitigate monopolistic market structures on a platform level. It emphasizes that compliance does not necessarily require a platform-wide gatekeeper or other forms of base layer regulation, but can instead be implemented higher up on the technology stack. This allows for more flexible approaches, based on asset- and application-types.

* Developers & Advisors anonymity
   * A lot of people are just blocked when asking questions about the devs - major red flag
* Token Audits were not disclosed (edit: they are on the website [coinsult](https://coinsult.net/projects/pepe-unchained/), [solidproof](https://pepeunchained.com/assets/documents/audit.pdf))
   * Additional concerns was that solidproof does not name pepe unchained on their website under regular projects ([pepeunchained](https://app.solidproof.io/projects/pepeunchained) is the only project I found that could be it)
* Changes in terminology (Tier 1 exchange listing to Major exchange listing) - this means it will probably launch on some shitty exchange.
* Tokens locked for 7 days post launch (although I could not find proof of this)
* Claims ""Your gateway to Pepe’s decentralized world. Explore trading, bridging, staking, and more with ease. Join the community to stay up to date on all new features."" Yet no real technical roadmap is provided and none of this is mentioned in the audit reports?
* Is this **just** a memecoin with clever marketing?

Turns out that was a huge mistake, when you want to withdrawal your funds from a profitable account they suspend all withdrawals completely from your account. I understand this is a security measure which would normally require a KYC check.

Well, my account is already KYC, and today I have had to KYC 3 different occasions, stating different sentences on a piece of paper and show my passport multiple times. Finally after about 11 hours of chat and discussions with their support team, my account was unlocked.

I then attempted to complete my withdrawal, this time I was hit with a 2FA on a mobile phone number that I removed on my account less than 30 days ago. To remove this, I need to again go through rounds of KYC and to this time my withdrawal still has not been processed.

So - a word of warning to traders out there, stay aware from Bybit, after some research it seems a common practice for this exchange to make it as difficult as possible to withdraw. This scenario may also happen on other exchanges, particularly if your making money during the bull market. When users are making bank, particularly on leveraged accounts exchanges begin to feel the heat on their books. Could be a warning sign for Bybit, maybe not. I dont know but its awfully inconvenient.

BTW they also did not provide any complaint solutions, so instead I raised a complaint with their domestic authorities (which will likely go nowhere).

Thought I would share this experience - if your making money, be sure to withdraw from exchanges frequently into your own custody.

\*edit - update here, ive now be told it will take 7 days for Bybit to remove the mobile number they applied to my account before it can be removed and my funds withdrawn. To me this is a red flag, something is going on with Bybit.",34,27,AlmostSneakers,CryptoCurrency

I have been in the tech and crypto scene for a bit and found that it is difficult to track the key indicators all in one place. 

So, for fun I’ve created the following site that gauges if we are in an alt season or not using the typical indicators.

It utilizes the CoinGecko API and TradingView charts.

I wanted to share it with you all to see if you had any feedback or caught anything I had missed.

The first issue you will notice is the values on the card do not match the charts. This is because CoinGecko returns the values and TradingView does the charts. The only fix is to create my own charts but that means I need to purchase CoinGeckos Pro API which costs a lot of money lol. However, the values are off by only a few percent and should still be dependable.

Please feel free to give me feedback on the site!

If you have any questions about the logic performed on the data, please visit the source code linked at the bottom of the website.

TLDR: take a look at my alt coin season indicator site and provide feedback.

The one you’d laugh at, mock in group chats, or call delusional in Reddit threads. That’s fine. I’m used to it. But here’s the thing about “crazy” people—they’re often the first to see patterns others ignore. So laugh all you want, but in a few years, when the dust settles, I’ll be the one saying, “I told you so.”

What am I talking about? Bitcoin. The dollar. Wealth inequality. The future of money. Let me show you a blueprint for a system that’s being built right in front of your eyes—one that most of you either don’t see or refuse to believe. You’ll probably roll your eyes and call me crazy, but remember this moment when it all starts happening.

# Bitcoin’s Origins: A Perfectly Timed “Solution”

Let’s start with Bitcoin’s origin story. It’s 2008—the financial crisis has shattered trust in banks and governments. Amid this chaos, a pseudonymous figure named Satoshi Nakamoto releases the Bitcoin white paper, promising a decentralized, deflationary currency immune to manipulation. People eat it up. It’s the ultimate middle finger to the establishment, right?

But let’s think critically here. **How convenient is it that Bitcoin emerged precisely when global trust in centralized systems was at an all-time low?** Too convenient. Timing matters, and the timing of Bitcoin’s release feels less like a coincidence and more like an engineered response.

And let’s not ignore Bitcoin’s technological roots. The SHA-256 algorithm, which secures Bitcoin’s blockchain, was developed by the NSA. While SHA-256 is open-source and widely used, it’s not a stretch to suggest the U.S. government may have had a hand in shaping Bitcoin’s foundations. After all, who benefits most from a digital, transparent, and traceable financial system? (Yes, I said traceable—because don’t let anyone fool you into thinking Bitcoin is truly anonymous. It’s pseudonymous, and every transaction is permanently etched onto a public ledger.)

If you’re still with me, here’s the kicker: The U.S. government didn’t need to announce Bitcoin as their creation. They let it grow organically, fueled by libertarian ideals and distrust in the system. They knew people would adopt it out of rebellion, unknowingly building the infrastructure for the very financial surveillance system they feared.

# Proof of Adoption: The Quiet Infiltration by the Elite

Now, let’s talk about what’s happened since. Bitcoin, once a niche experiment for tech enthusiasts, has grown into a trillion-dollar asset class. And here’s where it gets interesting: the very institutions Bitcoin was supposed to undermine are now its biggest backers.

* **BlackRock**: The world’s largest asset manager, with deep ties to governments and central banks, has been filing for Bitcoin ETFs and pushing institutional adoption. Fun fact: BlackRock’s CEO, Larry Fink, was once critical of Bitcoin, calling it a tool for money laundering. Now? He’s all-in. Ask yourself: why the sudden 180-degree shift?
* **MicroStrategy**: Michael Saylor, CEO of MicroStrategy, has been one of Bitcoin’s loudest advocates, investing billions of corporate funds into BTC. This isn’t just a corporate strategy—it’s part of a larger trend of institutions quietly accumulating Bitcoin while the average person hesitates.
* **Fidelity and Other Financial Giants**: Companies like Fidelity have been laying the groundwork for institutional Bitcoin adoption for years. These firms don’t make moves without inside knowledge or government alignment.

The narrative is clear: **Bitcoin is no longer the “people’s currency.”** It’s being hoarded by the same elite entities that control traditional finance. And if you think governments aren’t involved, you’re kidding yourself. They’re just letting their proxies—companies like BlackRock—do the dirty work.

# Why the U.S. Government Needs Bitcoin

Here’s where the puzzle pieces really come together. The U.S. dollar is in decline. Inflation is eroding its value, national debt is skyrocketing, and global rivals like China and Russia are pushing for alternatives. BRICS nations (Brazil, Russia, India, China, South Africa) are even developing their own reserve currency to challenge the dollar’s dominance.

The U.S. government knows this. They know the dollar’s days as the global reserve currency are numbered. And what’s the best way to transition out of a failing system? **Control the replacement before your rivals do.**

Bitcoin offers a solution:

1. **Deflationary Economics**: With its fixed supply of 21 million coins, Bitcoin is immune to inflation. This makes it an attractive reserve asset for nations and institutions.
2. **Global Neutrality**: Bitcoin isn’t tied to any one country, making it a perfect candidate for a new global financial system—one that the U.S. can influence quietly through early accumulation.
3. **Debt Reset Potential**: If Bitcoin’s value skyrockets (say, to $1 million or more per coin), governments holding large reserves could sell portions to pay off national debt or fund programs. It’s a clean slate for a broken system.

# The Trap of Bitcoin “Freedom”

But here’s the kicker: while Bitcoin appears to promise financial freedom, it’s also a Trojan Horse for unprecedented control. Governments aren’t just sitting idly by—they’re developing **Central Bank Digital Currencies (CBDCs)** to complement or even compete with Bitcoin. These CBDCs will:

* Be programmable, meaning governments can control how you spend your money.
* Be trackable, erasing any semblance of financial privacy.
* Tie directly to social systems, potentially linking your finances to things like credit scores or even social behavior.

Here’s the twisted beauty of it: Bitcoin will pave the way for mass adoption of digital currencies. Once people are comfortable with Bitcoin, governments will step in with CBDCs, offering stability and convenience. And by then, it’ll be too late. You’ll already be trapped in the system.

# Wealth Inequality and the New World Order

Let’s not sugarcoat this: Bitcoin will make some people unimaginably rich. But who benefits most? Early adopters and institutions. The average person, who buys in late or doesn’t buy at all, will be left behind. This isn’t an accident—it’s by design.

When fiat currencies collapse and Bitcoin takes center stage, the wealth divide will become unbridgeable. The elites will hold Bitcoin, land, and other hard assets. The rest? They’ll own depreciating fiat and worthless debt. This isn’t just financial inequality—it’s systemic anarchy, a world where power consolidates further into the hands of the few.

# But I Know What You’re Thinking…

“Schizo ramblings,” right? “This guy’s insane.” Sure. Laugh it up. Call me crazy. But just remember: every major upheaval in history was dismissed as impossible until it happened. People laughed at those who warned about the 2008 financial crisis. They laughed at Snowden’s revelations about mass surveillance. And they’re laughing now at the idea that Bitcoin is anything other than a benevolent invention.

But when you’re watching Bitcoin hit seven figures, when the dollar is collapsing, and when governments are rolling out CBDCs with a smile, just remember this post. I’ll be back to say, “I told you so.”

# One Final Thought

You don’t have to believe me. In fact, I don’t expect you to. But start asking questions. Why are institutions hoarding Bitcoin? Why are governments tolerating something that supposedly threatens their power? And why is a system built on “decentralization” being quietly co-opted by the very entities it was meant to replace?

Think critically. Connect the dots. And when the pieces fall into place, just remember: you heard it here first.",0,43,GC-Gittiwilo,CryptoCurrency

In 2008, when Satoshi released the BTC whitepaper it took off on the back of being the first blockchain which solved the double spend problem. Listen to Adam Back on how the previous projects Hash Cash, B-Money, Bitgold were already existing but not decentralised and had the critical issue of double spend problem.

I see a similar parallel in the layer 1 space where ALL layer ones focus on picking two of the three considerations of the trilemma (security - decentralisation - scalability) except Algorand.

**\*\*\*\*\*\*\* TLDR: Per Silvio, Algorand is the best layer 1 and only project to solve the blockchain trilemma and will eventually cut through the clutter of 100s of other layer 1s. \*\*\*\*\*\***

***Proof-of-Work***

The first approach is proof-of-work, famously used by Nakamoto for Bitcoin and inherited by many other blockchains. In this approach, at a very high level, users race to solve a very complex cryptographic puzzle. The first one to solve the puzzle has the right to append the next block to the chain. Proof-of-Work suffers from several flaws.

*First Flaw: Proof-of-Work Does Not Scale.* Proof-of-work is very slow. Bitcoin’s crypto puzzles are so hard in order to guarantee that one solution is found only every 10 minutes, no matter how many miners try to solve the crypto puzzle. We can understand expensive and fast. But expensive and slow is hard to understand. The world is a large place and one block of transactions every 10 minutes is hardly enough.

*Second Flaw: Proof-of-Work Results in De-Facto Centralization.* Proof-of-work has caused a tremendous concentration of power. This centralization is a consequence of the fact that Proof-of-Work is both expensive and wasteful. The amount of computation performed by the *miners* — that is, the users trying to solve the crypto puzzles —is stunning. Mining today utilizes racks and racks of specialized hardware and consumes an enormous amount of electricity. One miner wins the race and generates the new block, and the efforts of all the others are wasted. Without the subsidies that Bitcoin currently offers, the cost of posting a single transaction on Bitcoin’s blockchain is around $20. Not the way to go if you want to use the blockchain for everyday transactions like buying a slice of pizza or if you want to use it offer financial services to those 2.2 billion who are currently not served by the financial system.

The common user would lose money if she tried to solve the crypto puzzle with her laptop. Win or lose, she must pay for the electricity necessary to power the computations of her laptop. This amount of electricity may not be big, but her probability of winning is so small that, in expectation, she would lose money.

Only professional miners, who have made the capital expenditure necessary to buy racks and racks of hyper specialized mining equipment, can expect to make a small profit. Accordingly, only they participate in block generation. Furthermore, miners consociate in *mining pools*.

Today, Bitcoin’s blockchain is controlled by just three mining pools and Ethereum’s by just two mining pools. If they so decide, or if they are bribed to do so, these mining pools can rewrite the database: they can erase blocks or change the order of blocks. Proof-of-work has turned what was intended to be a decentralized system into an extremely centralized one.

*Third Flaw: Proof-of-Work Is Not Secure.* As we said, any blockchain that is centralized, whether by design or *de facto*, is insecure. But proof-of-work has additional vulnerabilities, and it is especially vulnerable to network attacks. A blockchain ultimately is a communication protocol, and any such protocol is executed over an underlying communication network. An adversary may thus attack either the protocol — e.g., by sending messages that are different from the prescribed ones — or the communication network itself — e.g., by interfering with routers, cables, etc.

Just how insecure proof-of-work is may be underestimated because the current way of analyzing a blockchain’s security is flawed. This analysis typically focuses only on protocol attacks and neglects network attacks that, especially in the context of proof-of-work, can be deadly. For instance, in a proof-of-work blockchain, an adversary capable of partitioning the communication network for an hour or two could double-spend with impunity. In a successful partitioning attack, an adversary prevents the messages sent by the users belonging to a set of users A from reaching the users in a separate set B, and vice versa. Network partitioning has not attracted much attention, because it is considered too expensive to be practical. But the cost of a network attack may be justified, once the gains are high enough. A truly borderless economy may be valued in trillions of dollars. And an adversary may be willing to ‘invest’ millions of dollars, if he stands to illicitly gain billions of dollars.

*Fourth Flaw: Forks.* Another disadvantage of proof-of-work is the unavoidable existence of *forks*. Whenever two or more users solve the crypto puzzles within a few seconds of each other, the chain branches because users may now see multiple candidates for the next block. A fork may continue to exist for a while, and all its branches may even be elongated by the addition of new blocks. But eventually, all branches but one will die, and all the blocks in the dead branches will disappear.

Forks are an unwelcome source of uncertainty and delay. If a payment made to you appears in the latest block added to the chain, you cannot consider yourself paid and ship the goods. This is so because some branch may overcome the current chain and your block may end up in a dead branch and vanish. Before considering yourself paid, you would need to wait for a sequence of blocks to be added to yours, so as to minimize the chance that a soft fork will arise and the block containing your payment will end up on a dead branch.

How long should you wait for? Some people recommend six blocks to be added after yours to be confident that your block will remain on the chain. Others recommend an even longer wait, if the payment made to you is sizable. Thus, rather than waiting ten minutes, to have reasonable confidence in the finality of a transaction, in reality you have to wait hours.

Some people have suggested making the crypto puzzles easier in order to speed up the process, for instance by making it possible to find a solution every minute, rather than every 10 minutes. However, by doing so, the probability of getting two solutions within a few seconds of each other increases significantly. The system can cope with an occasional soft fork, but not with very frequent forks.

Expenses, slowness, and uncertainty are indeed major flaws in the proof-of-work approach, but they pale in comparison with its fatal flaw.

*The Fatal Flaw in Proof-of-Work.* Recall the already discussed fatal flaw: *the whole economy is at the mercy of a small part of the economy.*

In proof-of-work, this small part of the economy is that owned by the miners. Since the miners own only a small fraction of the money in a proof-of-work blockchain, the chain is not secure.

***Delegated Proof-of-Stake***

A different approach is delegated proof-of-stake (PoS). This is a very simple idea. The community empowers a few special users, the *delegates*, to choose the next block, at least for a while. (For example, in EOS, the number of the delegates is 21.)

Delegated PoS is, therefore, centralized from the get-go. Hopefully, the chosen delegates are honest to begin with. However, relying on delegates remaining honest for a long time is risky.

Once again, we have that *the whole economy is at the mercy of a small part of the economy.* Indeed, in a delegated-PoS blockchain the delegates may own a tiny fraction of the total money in the system, yet the whole blockchain is secure if and only if the majority of delegates are honest.

*Additional Security Problems.* Even assuming that there is an ironclad guarantee that all the delegates will remain honest forever, they can easily be attacked. In particular, they can be brought down by a denial of service (DoS) attack. In such an attack, an adversary bombards any user of his choice with zillions of junk messages, causing the buffer of that unfortunate user to overflow. If a delegate were so bombarded, he would be unable to perform his job, namely collating new and valid transactions into the next block. The blockchain would grind to a halt.

DoS attacks are quite cheap and can be mounted instantly against not only 21 people but even 1000 people. Since delegates are known, even if they were kept in power for just a day or an hour or a minute, a determined adversary could bring down all the delegates by a fast DoS attack.

***Bonded Proof-of-Stake***

Bonded PoS allows 20 users, 200 users, as many as are willing, to put some money on the table — a bond — where they can no longer touch it. These are the users who select the next block on behalf of all of us. If they misbehave, their money is confiscated.

Does this approach work?

Let me ask a simpler question: how much of your disposable income can you afford to put hostage on the table? The answer is a very small amount. Bonded PoS therefore, not only makes it possible, but actually makes it *easy* for big thieves with deep pockets to put a disproportionate amount of money on the table for the sole purpose of controlling the blockchain.

But so what? If they misbehave, they lose their hostage money. However, a truly decentralized, scalable and secure blockchain should secure trillions of dollars in assets. And by misbehaving, a malicious user stands to make a few billion dollars. This being the case, do you think that he may fear having a few million dollars confiscated? This is just the price of doing business. And it is a small price at that.

Once more, in bonded PoS, we have the same fatal flaw: *the whole economy is at the mercy of a small part of the economy.* Indeed, in a bonded PoS this small part of the economy consists of (the owners of) “the money laying hostage on the table.”

In sum, prior approaches suffer from several drawbacks. We need a better design.

**Algorand’s Logic and Pure Proof-of-Stake.** Algorand’s logic is simple: it ties the security of the whole economy to the honesty of the *majority* of the economy, and makes it impossible for a small subset of the economy to control the fate of the whole economy.

Algorand is based on a new Proof-of-Stake: *Pure* *PoS*. Essentially, a Pure PoS does not try to keep users honest by the fear of imposing fines. Rather, it makes cheating by a minority of the money impossible and cheating by a majority of the money stupid.

In Algorand no money is ever hostage. All money is always where it should be: in your wallet, at your fingertips ready to be spent, or in the various financial instruments that the Algorand blockchain offers you. When you take in consideration all the money in the system, wherever it may be, the system is secure when most of the money is in honest hands.

As we said, it is impossible for the owners of a small fraction of the money to harm the whole system, and it would be silly for the owners of the majority of the money to misbehave so as to devalue their own holdings.

For example, in proof-of-work or bonded PoS, a few users can prevent other users from transacting. In Algorand, only the owners of the majority of the money could prevent other users from transacting. But if they did so, the reputation of the currency would be greatly harmed, the currency would no longer universally accepted, and its purchasing power would be greatly diminished. Not a good outcome for the owners of the majority of the money.

**Implementing Pure PoS.** Let us now see how Algorand uses pure PoS for choosing the next block. Remember the trilemma? We want block generation to be simultaneously scalable, secure, and decentralized.

At a very high level, in Algorand, a new block is constructed in two phases.

* In the first phase, a single token is randomly selected, and its owner is the user who proposes the next block.
* In the second phase, 1000 tokens are selected among all tokens currently in the system. The owners of these 1000 tokens are selected to be part of a phase-2 ‘committee,’ which approves the block proposed by the first user.

Accordingly, some member of the committee may be chosen twice or more generally some k times, in which case, that member will have k votes in the committee to approve the next block.

Why is the second phase necessary?

In any society, and blockchains are no exception, there is always a small percentage of bad actors to be found; let us say 1 percent. Maybe 2 percent. If one is unfortunate enough to live in a very dangerous society, 10 percent may be bad actors. Perhaps even 20 percent! But in no society will bad actors be in a majority; otherwise, there would not be a society. A society exists insofar as the majority of its members follow prescribed rules.

Assume that 10 percent of the tokens in Algorand belong to dishonest people. Then, one in ten times, the user selected in phase 1 to propose a block may be a bad actor. Accordingly, he may tell some users that the block is X and other users that the block is Y and so on and so forth, thereby creating disagreement about what the blockchain is.

Phase 2 eliminates this problem. Indeed, if you select at random 1000 tokens when at most 10 percent of the tokens are in dishonest hands, the probability that the majority of the selected coins belong to bad actors, that is, the probability that the majority of the committee’s votes are cast by bad actors is so low as to be negligible.

Assume that, this time around, you have not been selected to propose a block. Nor have you been selected to be part of a committee to approve a proposed block. But you see that a given block B has been approved by, say, 700 votes of the committee. Then, you know that B is indeed the next block.

**A Key Question.** At this high-level description, several questions naturally arise. Let us start with the most obvious one: *Who randomly chooses the committee?*

Suppose I tell you that I do. Then you might say “That is the most centralized system ever, and you are at the center of it!” Suppose I tell you that all users discuss until they agree on a thousand committee members who then agree on the block. Then you might tell me that, humanity being what it is, an entire lifetime is not going to be enough to select the thousand committee members that we require.

Algorand takes an unorthodox approach: *the committee members select themselves.* You may think “What? That is a terrible idea! Because if I am a bad actor, I am going to select myself to be a member of this committee. And the next. And the one after that…” But not so fast.

To belong to the committee, one of your coins must win an individual, cryptographically fair lottery that you run in isolation — that is, without talking to anyone else — in the privacy of your own computer. And since the lottery is cryptographically fair, you cannot alter the chances of being selected in the slightest. (Not even a nation state with huge computational resources would be able to increase the probability of being selected.)

To select 1,000 random tokens among, say, 10,000,000,000 tokens, each token is selected with probability 1,000/10,000,000,000 — i.e., with probability 1 in 10 million.

So, as soon as a user sees a block being proposed, she asks herself: can I be a member of the committee selected to approve a block? And how many votes will I have?

To answer these questions, she runs the cryptographic lottery on her laptop for each one of the tokens that she owns. (If a user has n tokens, additional technology essentially allows her to run a single lottery instead of n separate lotteries!)

Once a user runs her lottery, one of two cases occurs. Either none of her tokens wins the lottery, in which case whatever opinion she expresses about the block will be ignored. Or some k>1of her tokens win the lottery, in which case, she obtains a winning ticket, namely a short proof that everybody can easily verify that she has k votes in the committee. In this latter case, she propagates through the network (i) a winning ticket proving that she has k votes and (ii) her opinion about the block.

**Solving the Trilemma**. Let me argue that this sketched approach is — finally! — simultaneously scalable, secure, and decentralized.

*Scalability.*

How long does it take for a user to run her own lottery? Roughly a microsecond, no matter how many tokens she has. That is indeed superfast. (Additionally, all the lotteries are run independently of each other, so that no user has to wait for other users to finish running their lotteries.)

Once selected, each member propagates to the network a single, short and immediately computed message. So no matter how many users are in the system, the maximum number of messages that need to be propagated is 1000 short messages. Is this scalable? Yes!

*Security.*

Now we come to security. Assume that I am a very powerful adversary, capable of corrupting users extremely quickly whenever I want. Clearly, I would love to corrupt the members of the committee, but I have a problem: I do not know who they are.

This is so because committee members are selected by a secretly run, cryptographically fair, individual lottery. Thus, only they know who they are, up to the moment in which they propagate through the network both their winning tickets and their opinions about the block. Only at that time I might learn who the committee members are and, given my super powers, I can immediately corrupt the entire committee. But so what? Corrupting them at this time is too late. Whatever the committee members had to say, they have already said, and their winning tickets and up-or-down opinions about the block are virally propagating throughout the network. I have no more power to put their messages back in the bottle than a government has the power to put back in the bottle messages virally propagated by WikiLeaks.

In other words, the Algorand approach is secure because beforehand, an adversary does not know whom to corrupt, and by the time he does, corruption is useless.

Contrast this with having a fixed 1000-strong committee. As discussed before, even if the committee stayed in power for a minute, it would be vulnerable to a DoS attack. If the committee stayed in power for much longer, say a week, then the members could even be corrupted in the physical world via traditional means such as bribes. In Algorand’s case however, one would not know against whom to mount a DoS attack and once the committee has spoken, the DoS attack is useless.

*Decentralization.*

Finally, we come to decentralization. Are there a few users in charge of choosing the next block? No, there are not. Nor is there a fixed, 1000-strong, committee in charge of approving the block. This time, a committee has been randomly (and secretly) selected. Next time, a different committee will be randomly (and secretly) selected. Everybody has the chance of participating in the generation of a new block.

*Algorand’s Non-Forkable Chain.*

An additional advantage of Algorand’s technology is that its chain never forks. This is so because only one block can have the required threshold of committee votes. Accordingly, in Algorand all transactions are final. Once a block appears, you can count on it to be forever part of the chain. And if the new block contains a payment made to you, you may consider yourself paid and send the goods immediately.

The financial world has already its own risks and there is no need to burden it with the additional uncertainty of \`block disappearance.’ By the way, when I said that Algorand’s chain never forks, I somewhat lied. Indeed, forks may occur in Algorand but they are very rare. The probability of forking in Algorand is, by design, 10⁻¹⁸. This probability may appear a strange choice, but it actually has a natural explanation. Physicists tell us that 10¹⁸ happens to be the number of seconds from the Big Bang until now. In other words, if you produce a block a second, a very good clip by the way, you may see a soft fork, but you would have to wait for the lifetime of the universe to see it.",297,224,DA_Maverick_AD,CryptoCurrency

2024-12-01 22:22:20,This is OpenGPU Network ,"They're building a decentralised alternative to AWS. The project launched in April and team members have worked for European Central Bank developing CBDCs (according to the team). They aren't publicly doxed yet but have doxed privately to Certik: https://skynet.certik.com/projects/opengpu. The token is currently at 60mil market cap and will be migrated to the L1 within the month when it goes live. It's basically a blockchain-based network where in a few clicks people with consumer to enterprise grade hardware can instantly lend out their GPU compute power and get paid in the token. Al companies can use the network at prices much more competitive than centralised solutiohs. The L1 and main net are launching by the end of this quarter. If the team delivers (their testnet functions flawlessly and is actually being used by some web3 Al Agent companies to train their bots already) I see this going 500mil+ in 2025. How much higher depends on whether the team is smart enough to get it there. It's theoretically an Akash/Bittensor killer. 


From the team: 

Overview:
At OpenGPU we've built a decentralized GPU Computing network that acts like a Bitcoin block validator. Individuals send their requests to a pool and GPU Providers compete with each other (based on factors such as GPU power and economical advantage) to be the one that executes these tasks.
Particularly AI Projects facing the challenge of scalability via traditional systems can leverage the power of this limitlessly scalable system without the need to adapt any infrastructure. In brief, as an AI company you simply push your AI model via a docker container and the network handles the rest. We're creating a competitive, decentralised marketplace for provision of the resources needed to run projects in both the traditional and Web3 spaces.

2024-12-01 20:37:42,Doge problems ,"The biggest problem with doge, the real thing holding it back is the constant rhetoric of “Hodl” don’t ever sell. The thing is, people care about doge for a few months every 4 years. The only reason bitcoin is worth so much is because people buy and sell it regularly. People care about it all the time. Doge could get here, but we need to continue the push to be more of an alt than a “meme” we have made the jump, just need to finish the job. Hodl, sell for profit, invite more people, we all have to work together as a community, not just once every 4 years to try to pop a massive profit!

It worked but I'm getting access to an empty wallet. Now I'm trying to understand what the chances of the shift forward would lead to a valid wallet address. Basically did I access the wallet and something is wrong with the funds.. or did I just randomly access an empty wallet?

I am interested in learning more about the circulating supply and max supply of Polygon. Here is a Chart and a spreadsheet that I created:

•Chart summarize circulating supply of 
 -MATIC
 -POL
 -MATIC+POL

•spreadsheet summarize Inflation.

Please note that the numbers for 2023 and 2024 are not fully correct. I do not think that the supply of end 2023 Was 11.38B or for end 2024 10.29B. But I haven't found better numbers for the both years. 


If Inflation is 2% per year from now on, wouldn't that mean that the max supply of 10.31B will be 2% higher each year?

Please let me know what you think. 
And do not hesitate to tell, if I have some numbers wrong and, so I can change them. Also please let me know your source.

2024-12-01 18:48:12,I analyzed Ben Cowen's predictions and made a spreadsheet + video about it,"**TL;DR:** A detailed analysis of Benjamin Cowen's crypto predictions in 2023 reveals a surprisingly poor track record. Out of 17 predictions analyzed, 15 were wrong, 1 was partially correct, and only 1 was fully accurate. [Link to the video is **here**.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FId5Ji-Tw0E)

I don't want to waste anyone's time (+ ADHD here) so I'll get right into it. 

**METHODOLOGY**

I made a spreadsheet ([available here] (https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1uglm1iXVYqLXjYGah6_co7agDBlXK4i7ZuMC6aZrHaE/edit?usp=sharing)) where I kept track of Ben's exact statements and predictions regarding Bitcoin (price and dominance), Ethereum, and altcoins. The idea behind it wasn't to publish this or make a video about it - it was to use it for my own sanity, because I felt many of his predictions fell short, but could never point my finger as to why. I focused on predictions made in 2023 for fair evaluation, since some need months/years to play out. Then, I methodically checked each prediction against actual market performance and noted if it panned out or not. I made a video about it because, honestly, it's easier and faster to follow than clicking on each link in the spreadsheet. I'm not a youtuber, I don't need your subs, and this is the only video I'll ever publish. I just want to inform you.

**CONCLUSIONS**

Out of 17 statements that I followed up on, 15 ended up not panning out. 1 was partially correct, and another one was fully correct. Ben's predictions missed on the timing component, the value component, or both (in most cases). I won't go into specific statements - you have either the spreadsheet or the video to take a look at.

**TAKEAWAY**

In the end, this isn't about Ben at all. It's about EVERY YouTube and X crypto personality you follow. Here's the critical advice:

* Document EXACT statements - when an influencer makes a prediction, write down the EXACT words, including specific price targets, time frames, and conditions.

* Beware of narrative shifting - many influencers have a habit of slowly tweaking their narrative. They'll subtly modify their original statement over time so that when something eventually happens, they can claim they ""predicted"" it.

* Time and value matter - a prediction isn't just about being right eventually. The specific time frame and exact value are crucial. If someone predicts Bitcoin will hit $100k ""sometime in the future"", that's not a real prediction.

Start a spreadsheet. Track the precise claims. Compare them to actual market performance. You'll be shocked how often ""expert"" predictions fall apart under scrutiny.

Bottom Line: Do your own research. Be critical. Don't worship any single crypto influencer, no matter how popular they are.",165,127,pandazealot,CryptoCurrency

Most of everything will see a 3x minimum this bull run with no issue. But I have yet to hear anyone talk about how well UNI will perform this cycle. It seems like almost guaranteed 5x this cycle.

Don't get me wrong I'm bullish towards alot of the prior mentioned coin and get just as gitty when I see news about XRP as the next guy even if it seems like a repeat of last cycle. Alt coins in a broad view will do great the next few months aside from current administration to changeover (speaking on the US). We can't really deny this.

I have always been relatively content with bybit flexible staking rewards and now added some positions is stable liq pools on beefy. But DAMN! It cost me a lot of money and time to figure it all out. Aggregators, bridges, wrapping and chains. There are even some AI pools that switch your coins between pools based on APY.

2024-12-01 16:43:12,You should really be using CoinGecko over CoinMarketCap,"For many Crypto Researchers if you want to check MarketCap rankings you probably instinctively launch up CoinMarketCap and start researching through there. Although it can be an ok surface level tool. Coinmarketcap is problematic for a few reasons:

* It's owned by Binance who has a huge history of malicious behavior in favor of personal growth.
* It's information for token specific information such as circulating supply is often out of date or completely wrong.
* Concerns about pay to play for Exchange rankings and token information by CMC. 

Beyond the obvious conflict of interests of CMC having a potential bias in rankings for Binance/BNB v. Competitors.

The biggest and most problematic is Coin / Token Information being inaccurate almost all the time. Imagine doing your best for due diligence on a project but the information that CoinMarketCap gives you is either out of date or completely inaccurate. This happens a lot and almost every Crypto project will complain that CMC has inaccurate circulating supply information

Although [CoinGecko ](https://www.coingecko.com/)made a mistake on Moons by counting Arb One Moon supply as new supply, **I have never seen an example of CMC having more reliable information than CoinGecko** for coin/token information.

Also have a huge bag of SOL with average price around $18....so killing it there as well.

ADA - One of my biggest holdings alongside BTC and ETH. I’ve been accumulating for the past few months, with most of it done before November 6. My average price per coin is around 32c.

Worst performer:

Bullish picks:

\- To everyone congratulating me on learning a lifelong lesson, I have moved all my crypto from these accounts.   
\- So no lesson learnt.  
\- For now though all my crypto on this person's swap site, which is reputable according to coinbase... is gone...  
\- I am going to continue giving this individual the benefit of the doubt, but I will eventually release which swap site and crypto he created.  
\------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------  
  
The actual creator of a cryptocurrency, who runs a ""swap"" site was attempting to help me with an ""RPC"" issue.  
he sent me here: [corefusoinlabs.pages.dev](http://corefusoinlabs.pages.dev)

It told me to enter my private key for ""trust wallet""... I did... he was walking me through the steps...

I also entered it for my coinbase wallet, as the issue was the two wallets were creating ""synching"" problems.

Note: Coinbase wallets allow you to change your private key. Did that instantly afterwards. Trust does not.

I would remove all funds from trust wallet to a new wallet. But I am vesting this cryptocurrency on his website, so it is locked in for 30 days. And removing it would lose 70% of my funds according to the terms of staking he set up.

So either unstake/unlock my crypto for a 70% loss... or hope this dude, who runs this exchange/crypto is legit...

The website was just so bad... I saw that as I was doing it... but he created the coin...

So why would he try and take $500 USD from some dude, when he has buyback/burn programs for far more than that every month.",0,30,RadiantJelly3253,CryptoCurrency

2024-11-30 13:51:21,Could Quantum Resistance Make or Break Ethereum?,"There is some buzz about Ethereum's bold move to address security risks of quantum computing. 

It's not really that bold. 

Despite the misinformation throughout the crypto space, the world is actively working on how to upgrade their cryptography. 

NIST approved new standards months ago, and had been working on them for many years

Upgrading to new cryptography will be required going forward and certainly Ethereum finally understands that.

The debate used to be how long can you hold off on addressing it. Obviously existing chains, systems, etc would rather be working on other things as the article points out. 

But now people are hearing about quantum everywhere.

Companies like NVIDIA, GOOGLE, AWS, IBM, MICROSOFT are all actively working on how to implement the new standards.

People pay attention to what they are working on. The Linux Post Quantum Cryptography Association includes all these companies.

And Nvidia even recently partnered with Google Quantum AI.

So, eth finally decided to stop fighting it and start working on it. 

But elsewhere talking heads are not grasping the reality.

They try to push it aside calling it a narrative designed to scare people into moving funds into coins with the proper protection.  

Obviously this is worldwide issue and not a crypto narrative. People want to be sure all their assets are safe, not just crypto. 

And as noted,  the cryptography exists, so why not start the work? I suspect we'll see more talk about how bitcoin is actively working on this as well... I hope.  There are a couple BIPS but the impacts are still concerning.

Of course the transition will be hard for even for centralized companies. And even harder for existing decentralized chains.",10,48,Original-Assistant-8,CryptoCurrency

2024-11-30 06:57:06,What needs to happen for crypto to become mainstream and a currency used more frequent ,"Hear me out. This is not an Anti crypto or Bitcoin post. But this is a post regarding the complexity of bitcoin and storage for the average or novice crypto holder/trader. Will how Bitcoin is stored and or traded ever become easier so that the mainstream average person or older people can buy/trade/hold bitcoin. Now when you read this. You are coming from an advanced or better understanding of crypto than me or the average person. I have bought and or held crypto since 2016ish. I know little about cold wallets and I am just now setting up a trezor for my kids so that I can pass on btc to them for part of their inheritance. I believe like most of you that the value will increase. That's not the point of this discussion. What needs to happen or will happen so Bitcoin is more adaptable or usable for the average person. Ask any of your friends and I bet 50% or higher don't have a clue about what blockchain even is. Then ask them about cold storage for their crypto. If Bitcoin is going to become mainstream and become a larger token used for currency, it will have to become easier for the public to grasp and not get frustrated and give up trying to understand the complexity of what crypto/bitcoin is and how to store it safely so it can't be hacked.

You reading this and being familiar with how everything I have mentioned works, this might seem like a stretch. But if your grandparents or Joe blow is going to use crypto. It will have to become much easier to grasp and store it safely. Just setting up my wallet there is seed phrases, 12-24 word passwords, hidden wallets, default wallets, seed words I need to store and keep private to access my wallet and acct. not a chance 50% of the elderly can safely invest a decent part of their retirement in crypto and store it safely without a lot of help and at best they will be confused about the set up and not follow through. The more people involved in crypto, the quicker it becomes mainstream and prices grow even higher. Just a quick glance on the internet and billions of crypto is still being hacked and stolen each year. 

This is concerning to someone who is moving $6-7 figures in crypto to store in a wallet or cold storage. I lost $13k in 2020 or so by having random coins I had to sell then convert to this token from that token to cash out in cash. I sent coins from a wrong coin to another coin address and I was SOL. Lost that money and even hired a crypto attorney to see if they could recover my funds. Apparently once it went into that coin or wallet by my own doing and accident, There was no recovering them. 

Again that's not part of this discussion but the complexity of some trading could result is large losses. The average retiree won't be willing to put 1/3 or 1/2 their retirement into a coin or system that they will need training and help setting up a wallet to store their funds. My long winded post comes to the question. What can or will have to happen for btc to become mainstream enough the average or novice investor feels safe enough to be able to buy in and place part of their retirement in crypto. 


Setting up phrases then passworkd phrases to get in your trezor that can't be stored online for fear of hacking will scare your average investor. You reading this think this is foreign thinking because you have a basic or even advance understanding of crypto buying, sending and storing. Even now as I am setting up a tree safe 5, I am a little concerned about what I can do online in regards to being connected to the internet and what can and can't be hacked. So I store my words for my acct and trezor in a safe. How do you safely store your words and info in the case you pass away and need to transfer your assets to your kids. I don't think you want to store the words or passwords to your accts in your trust or will, people have access to that. I know there are stampings and metal plates you can store your passwords on but who and where do you trust to keep those. 

Your average 60-80 year old who is retired or close to retiring won't feel safe putting 6-7 figures in a system that is this complex to learn for a novice. I buy stocks , I pass away, my kids inherit my accts and they can keep or liquidate the stocks for liquid. I pass away and give them a cold storage wallet with the passwords and how to access the btc, that's a burden they now have to learn. Will crypto always be so complicated for those who don't spend time learning all the ins-outs of security. Buying Microsoft or Apple stock is simple enough. 

I can go to cashapp and buy stocks . I've been investing in stocks and various assets for 35 years, I've never been so worried about am I doing this and that right not to lose or have my btc hacked. Will the system ever become easy and mainstream enough that a lot of this fear is removed. I know debit cards are stolen and checking accts hacked, money moved. But your average person isn't near as worried about that as they are losing their crypto. I read between 6-17% of adults own crypto, that number needs to skyrocket to become mainstream. 

Look at the prices now, think of 50-60-80% of adults who own crypto, what that would do to the price. For crypto to become a mainstream form of currency. A lot of this fear and difficulty needs to be removed. Some of you reading this since you understand this will think this post is over the top. I assure you if you ask 50 people most of them have 2 concerns. How to buy and send and how to store it safely. Until that fear eases. Will crypto ever reach the price predictions some say if the average person can't buy, trade and store crypto without these worries. Again I own crypto. Will buy crypto, will store it to pass to my kids one day. But I feel the complexity of how to do this reamains one of the sticking points to what needs to become easier so the price reaches insane highs while removing the doubt of will I lose my crypto. 

Any thoughts if or how crypto becomes easier for the average Joe or retiree to buy and store becomes easier. Sorry for the long winded post but I hope you get the jist of the post.

Edit to post****+
Just to add to the complexity. I just ordered a tezor safe 5 and I had to cancel the order. I don't own a computer, only an iPhone and iPad. I trade 7 figures worth of stocks and options a week off an iPad but can't run a cold wallet from an iPad. This has to become easier and more mainstream . I can log in my bank acct with my iPad. Transfer or wire 6 figures to my investing acct. trade stocks. Sell stocks, wire the money back to my bank acct. buy bitcoin on cashapp and coinbase on my iPad but not use it for cold storage. Head scratching. ",0,40,mymomsaidiamsmart,CryptoCurrency
2024-11-30 06:54:44,"While everyone focuses on Saylor and El Salvador, the number 1 Bitcoin degen is actually Bhutan","Here are some facts and statistics about Bhutan I pulled out:

*  Bhutan holds 1/3 of its entire GDP in Bitcoin, 13k Bitcoins in total
* The 13k Bitcoins is more than 2x El Salvador's holdings, and El Salvador has over 6 million citizens compared to 750k for Bhutan. So ""BTC holdings per capita"" is close to 20x for Bhutan compared to El Salvador
* Bhutan started getting into the crypto space in 2019, with BTC mining. This is before the hype phase in 2021.
* They mine BTC through hydroelectric power (clean energy). Once again ahead of the game and they don't need to spend millions of money/stonks like SaylorMoon or El Salvador. End 2021, they quietly started construction on the largest ever mining site while the buzz was around El Salvador buying BTC.
* So basically they are using BTC as a true ""revenue stream"" where a large part of their holdings are truly in BTC. You can think of Bhutan as your typical crypto degen, but instead as a crypto bro it is a country version of it.

Why do y'all think despite all these great use cases and being the first country ever to truly hold an enormous % of their GDP in Bitcoin, Bhutan does not have the attention?

But now, how do I actually spend the money that I want to take? 

Do I need to go to a crypto marketplace? …Transfer to a different exchange? Does this have to do with paying my taxes? Should I pull all of my money out of Binance? Any help would be appreciated.

2024-11-30 03:55:58,Scammed out of Crypto — Way to Recover?,"It wasn’t me that was scammed, but a family member of mine. They had XRP sitting in a Lobster wallet until they decided to convert it to XLM and transfer it over to a “QFS Ledger” wallet. After realizing it was a scam, they converted the XLM to Bitcoin, then tried to transfer the BTC to their cashapp. The BTC
never showed up, and of course there’s no transaction history in the QFS Ledger “wallet” (obviously, because it was fake). 

I began chatting with someone on X who was giving off pretty legit vibes, and I even began the process of “recovering” the stolen crypto (in quotes because i’m well aware that could have been a scam also) with them, but had to stop the process when transferring $20 over to a Trust crypto wallet turned into them wanting me to send $350. At that point, scam or not, it wasn’t worth the money. 

But as I see XRP on the up, I continue to wonder, is there a way stolen crypto can be genuinely recovered?  Are there people out there that actually can? If there’s authenticity to this, I’m willing to pay. I understand good work isn’t free, but I wasn’t willing to put myself, or family member, in a financially vulnerable position, or even a position where our info could be compromised, over a few hundred bucks. Just not worth it, but I still do ponder if there’s a solution.
Any advice is appreciated, apologies for a rant being my first post on this sub.
Happy late turkey day

TL;DR
Family member transferred crypto to fradulent wallet. I was contact with someone who claimed to know how to recover, but became wary after being asked to transfer money to a wallet they had sent me the passphrase to set up. ",0,41,kenzykaye,CryptoCurrency

2024-11-30 03:04:21,BTCTKVR: Privacy Magazine Makes Crypto Cypherpunk Again,"As cryptocurrency adoption grows, the cypherpunk spirit appears to be fading. The crypto anarchists who started it all often find themselves outnumbered and have their voices drowned out by misguided speculators who are more than willing to surrender their privacy and sovereignty in exchange for some price pumps. 

However, these cypherpunk principles are much more than an expression of OG sentiments — they are a return to first principles and the initial social contract which turned Bitcoin into an unstoppable global phenomenon.

This groundbreaking magazine, open sourced and made available to the entire world today, comprises 154 pages of expert insights and practical guides. The entire content is available freely under the Creative Commons Zero license – which means that you can read, copy, modify, translate, print, and even sell without asking for permission.

The goal is to spread information about financial privacy all around the world, through the power of open source knowledge!

BTCTKVR: Privacy Edition includes 32 contributions from 30 different authors, and covers the privacy features of popular cryptocurrencies including Bitcoin, Monero, Zcash, Zano, Litecoin, Alephium, Nym, Beam, and Firo.

Exploring the Depths of Privacy:
The magazine features an array of articles:• Bitcoin Privacy: Articles explore the technical limitations of Bitcoin privacy, how they are supplemented with CoinJoin technology, and why setting up BTCPay Server and Wasabi Wallet might be a good idea.

• Monero Privacy: Two excellent articles, written by community members Untraceable and Tuxsudo, explain the technical and philosophical intricacies of the world’s leading privacy coin.

• Litecoin Privacy: Thanks to the addition of MWEB (Mimble Wimble Extension Block), Litecoin is now the most liquid and widely-adopted privacy coin. Read the article by Chris on Crypto to understand how it works.

• Zcash & Firo: Insights into zero-knowledge proofs and their implications for user privacy. The most avant-garde of privacy cryptocurrencies get their moment in the spotlight, with three excellent dedicated articles.

• Zano & Beam: The future of DeFi looks promising, with confidential assets that user can transfer without revealing any public information about amounts or the parties involved. Think about the limitless potential of building private internet companies, which issue shares and pay dividends without letting any outsiders know.

• BTCPay Setup: A step-by-step setup guide for BTCPay Server, written by anml_litecoin, will teach you how to receive payments with maximum privacy.

Philosophical Underpinnings:
Beyond the technical considerations, BTCTKVR: Privacy Edition highlights the philosophical necessity of financial privacy in a digital world. The magazine posits that privacy is not just a feature but a fundamental right that’s crucial for the protection of individual freedoms.

A Broad, Non-Tribal Perspective:
The publication includes contributions from:• Josh Swihart, CEO of Electric Coin Company, who offers unique insights into the future of Zcash.• Eli Ben-Sasson, CEO of Starkware, who explains the scalability and privacy benefits of ZK STARKs.• Naomi Brockwell and Joel Valenzuela, known for their advocacy in privacy and freedom of transactions.• Most notably, the magazine features the works of grassroots cypherpunks, bringing fresh perspectives to the privacy discourse.

A Unique Visual Experience:
Illustrations by Annie bring a unique flavor to the magazine, with Pepe the Frog leading readers through the articles in a comic book style. This artistic choice aims to make the topic of privacy more approachable, using humor and satire to engage readers at multiple levels.

Launch and Distribution:
BTCTKVR: Privacy Edition was officially unveiled at MoneroTopia on November 16th 2024, where the initial batch of 100 physical copies was distributed. The magazine is now accessible globally online, so anyone can read it without any barriers.

Call to Action:
This publication isn't just about sharing knowledge; it's a call to action for cryptocurrency enthusiasts worldwide to understand and use privacy techniques. Blockchains were made to liberate us from central control, not to create panopticons for governments and corporations. So the more people learn how to protect their financial privacy, the faster the world achieves liberation via freedom of transactions.

Availability:
• Digital Copy: Available for free download at https://bitcoin-takeover.com/privacymag• Physical Copy: While some copies will get printed for privacy-related events (MoneroTopia, MoneroKon), everyone is encouraged to print their own magazines in order to spread the knowledge. But if you really want to order a print, you can send an e-mail.• Print your own magazine: https://github.com/VladdyC/privacymag

About BTCTKVR:
The BTCTKVR project started out with the Bitcoin Takeover podcast (February 2019 - Present) and the BTCKVR magazines (July 2021 - Present) — as hosted, designed, and coordinated by Vlad Costea. It aims to provide information to people who genuinely want to use the power of Bitcoin to improve the world beyond the memes and hopium-infused narratives.

2024-11-29 21:11:55,I hope people can see whats happening with US based cryptos and Bitcoin,"Crypto investor since 2017, made good money, enough to quit my job in my mid 30s and travel and start a business and do other things I want with my life. Doesnt mean I know anything.

It is my belief that at some point, just like every other market, there will be a bust/selection period where 99% of projects become worthless. Of the remaining survivors, maybe 5-6 take up 80-85% of the market share, 5-6 take up 5-10% and the remaining hundreds or thousands of coins make up the last 5-10%

Example: Theres Verizon, Att, T mobile at the top, then theres tracfone and boost and mint mobile, then theres 100 that nobody knows anything about. There are 100s of brands of batteries but very few companies who actually make the batteries. Tons of tv companies, 5-6 that people know, dozens that we dont, 100s of other ones, and only a handful of huge manufacturers that make everyones tvs at the same place.

This is what will happen IMO because it always does, since forever.

And while I dont really care if youre a fan of the US or not, the US is the strongest economy in the world, and it is in the best position to harness this and benefit from it and control the direction of the space in the US and global narrative. Im not saying this is the best for crypto or the world, but I think it's ignorant to outright say it wont matter.

With the US and other countries getting on board with a strategic reserve, its clear bitcoin is and will continue to be a winner for the foreseeable future.

I believe this is also why we have the Dino/US coins pumping as their leaders have recently all been meeting together with some of them like Hoskinson even getting involved directly with legislators, meeting with senators, getting in front of congress and talking about what is best for us. Founders have all recently met, are all ISO 20022 compliant, and are all going nuts. I think this is a winning recipe for this cycle and for the future and I just want people to be aware of it. These projects **XLM XRP ADA HBAR ALGO** are outperforming a lot of other coins and I believe this is why, despite people starting to call them all irrelevant before this happened.

I am saying this because this is my third cycle in the space and have wasted time and money looking for pumpy coins when if I had just kept my money where I had it 7 years ago in these Dino coins (in XRP and ADA anyways), id have been proven right in my early conviction of these projects. Look at the narrative, research it, and make an educated guess. Do not ignore these trends and its ok to take risks on meme coins with a little bit of your portfolio but make sure you are on the right side of history when it all shakes out, because it will at some point in the not so distant future.",1162,563,TheTreeOneFour,CryptoCurrency

Hey everyone!

For me (have been here since 2016), nothing is worse than realizing you could have increased your holdings by selling when you sensed the market was peaking.

That's why I created [kollit.ai](http://kollit.ai) ! I am super excited to share it with you and hear what you think. It is a personal project that's been in the works for over 6 months. Around a year ago, as I prepared myself for the upcoming (inevitable) bull run, I wanted to figure out the best way to take profits to prepare myself for the next (also inevitable)  bear market. Obviously, I'm not interested in selling all my holdings, nor do I want to DCA out. While DCA works okay, it doesn't quite capture my specific wants and needs.

It's a (free with paid options) tool that helps you craft your perfect profit-taking (and market entry) strategy, based on **your** market outlook and predictions.

So, how does it work? It minimizes ""regret""—both the regret of action (""Fuck, I shouldn't have sold at that price"") and the regret of inaction (""Should've sold when I had the chance""). My algorithm balances these two regrets to output a strategy that fits you perfectly.

Getting started is easy:

* Visit the landing page to understand if this tool fits your needs
* Enter **5 price points** for each asset you want a strategy for
* Play around with a few parameters like **risk tolerance** and **execution pace**
* And you're all set!

I'm just wrapping up the closed alpha stage and opening registration to everyone. For now, I'm allowing a few dozen people each day to keep things smooth and make sure everything works.

I'm also thrilled to introduce a new feature that wasn't in the alpha—**Wisdom of the Crowd**. You can now check the asset page to see how many active predictions each asset has, and when an asset reaches over 100 active predictions, you can harness the collective insights to give your strategy an extra boost!

As a launch promotion, every new user gets **12 extra free tokens** \+ **1 token for each month** they log in :)

I'm a solo dev and poured my heart into this, using every spare moment I had. Maintaining this project costs over $60 a month (thanks to machine learning and all the calculations), so if you like what you see, I'd really appreciate it if you'd consider buying a token package :) However, this tool can be completely free! so I encourage you to try it out and tell me what you think or what you'd want to see.
Because I listen to you :D

Although currently it's not **not** mobile friendly, sorry for the inconvenience, it's in work.

**New Features:**

* Added Google authentication (if you encounter an /auth/auth-code-error, try replacing it with /dashboard)
* New landing page to better understand the tool's capabilities


**For those siging up without google:** I ask for birthdate, name and country in the signup. The birthdate is for legal reasons, verify that you are over 18. The name is for the avatar and notification emails in the future, and country is for me, if you want to keep it private just put another country as you can also use a made up name.

**tldr: Sensible co-founder and CEO Jacob Frantz is here to answer questions and request your feedback. Jacob and his team are building Sensible, a high yield account for your crypto. Sensible’s investors include Coinbase Ventures.**

**Today, they’ve launched invite-only access exclusively to** r/cc **members. When you refer a friend to Sensible, we boost your yield by reducing the fee we take on interest earned. Join via email signup at:** [**holdsensible.com?vip=rcc**](https://holdsensible.com?vip=rcc)

**Ask him about: Sensible (**[holdsensible.com](https://holdsensible.com)**), Retail sentiment, Building consumer apps in crypto and beyond**

**Answer questions about: Do you buy and hold, or regularly trade? Feature requests for Sensible? PoS or PoW? Cake or pie?**

Hey everyone!

I’m the founder of Sensible, a high yield account for your crypto. Crypto investors we’ve spoken to view crypto as a long-term investment, not a lottery ticket — but most crypto platforms are focused on getting you to trade every new token rather than getting the most out of your investment.

We made Sensible so that people who are holding the major cryptocurrencies — Bitcoin, Eth, and Sol — can put their crypto to work and earn a variable 2.5%-7.5% interest. We believe that everyday investors should have access to the same power of compounding interest that many of the more sophisticated investors are already using. Sensible works by enabling you to participate in staking (a blockchain-native way to earn interest while securing the network) via liquid staking tokens, which means you won’t have a lockup if you want to withdraw.

Sensible allows 24/7 withdraws, with no account fees or minimums. And unlike the other places that have offered yield on crypto over the years (we have that scar tissue, too), Sensible is *fully self-custody*, meaning that you remain in control of your crypto via your email address, and we could never access it even if we wanted to.

You can get started using Sensible at [holdsensible.com?vip=rcc](http://holdsensible.com?vip=rcc). Make an account via email (no SSN or credit card), and easily fund your account via a direct connection to Coinbase. As soon as you transfer, you start earning interest. Sensible takes 20% of the interest you earn, so we only make money if you do. Right now, we support ETH; with SOL and BTC coming soon.

Today, we’re giving people on r/cc invite-only access. You’re one of the first groups of people with access to Sensible, and you’re the only group allowed to invite friends — referrals will boost APY for yourself and your friend.

We’re sharing this here today and working with the r/cc mods because we’re hoping to get your thoughts and feedback while we continue to make Sensible better and more useful. We’ve worked closely with subreddits before — previously we built a marketplace for Reddit’s collectible avatars that did thousands of trades between redditors. We believe in building products for communities. Thanks for your time!",1,116,whirlwind2020,CryptoCurrency

2024-11-29 13:26:16,3 High Yield APR Projects,"I want to introduce you to **3 high-yield APR projects** that have proven themselves over time. These are not hype-driven projects, but rather ones with **consistent APR%** that have shown reliability.

I’ll present **2 established projects** ^((maybe hated)) and **1 new project**. Let’s dive in!  
This post is not about whether the token is good or bad, but only about high APR gains and a passive income.

1️⃣ **Ontology (ONT)**

**APR**: 25-35%  
**Payout**: after a staking Cycle (several days, around 21 days)

Ontology uses a **dual-token model**, where staking ONT in your wallet earns you **ONG (Ontology Gas)**. This second token is used to pay transaction fees and represents a steady income stream.

2️⃣ **NEO**

**APR**: 15-22%  
**Payout**: every second, refresh your wallet and claim instantly your rewards

NEO is one of the early pioneers in the blockchain space, often referred to as the ""Chinese Ethereum."" By staking NEO, you earn **GAS tokens**, which power transactions on the network.

3️⃣ **Aethir (ATH)**

**APR**: 5% - 275%  
**Payout**: Every week on Thursday

Aethir is a fresh, cutting-edge project focusing on **decentralized cloud infrastructure** for AI, gaming, and metaverse applications. By running **Checker Nodes**, you can earn attractive staking rewards. You can chose between AI Staking or Gaming Staking. The longer you lock your coins, the more APR you get. The maximum is 4 years. **Aethir has a large number of partners** (you get a lot of bonus) and they give Aethir users coins in the form of airdrops or discounts on other nodes. Everyone who has been with Aethir since the beginning should have an APR of about 400% which is paid out weekly.

If you find a good entry point, the staking rewards will pay off in the long term, even in a bear market. You can generate a good passive income. If you are interested i can tell more details or show statistics of a passive income.",0,5,Ultra918,CryptoCurrency

2024-11-28 13:43:07,When To Avoid Selling Crypto!?,"We've all been there - the market takes a sudden dip and the fear sets in. The urge to sell and cut your losses can be overwhelming. However, panic selling is one of the worst things you can do when it comes to investing in cryptocurrencies, especially Bitcoin so for that fact we will use $BTC as today’s sentimental point in this context.

Here's why you should avoid panic selling Bitcoin:

1. Bitcoin is Volatile by Nature: The cryptocurrency market is known for its high volatility. Prices can fluctuate dramatically, both up and down, in a short period of time. Selling during a dip means you're likely to miss out on the inevitable rebound.

2. Bitcoin Tends to Recover: History has shown that Bitcoin has always recovered from its dips, often reaching new all-time highs. If you had sold your Bitcoin during previous market crashes, you would have missed out on massive gains.

3. Timing the Market is Extremely Difficult: It's nearly impossible to perfectly time the market and predict when the next dip or surge will happen. Trying to do so often leads to making emotional decisions that end up costing you.

4. Zoom Out and See the Bigger Picture: If you've been holding Bitcoin for a while, chances are you're still sitting on significant gains. Don't let a temporary dip erase all the hard-earned profits you've made. Take a step back and look at the long-term trend. 

The key is to remain patient and level-headed. Give it 12-24 hours before making any decisions. Often, a good night's sleep and a fresh perspective can make all the difference. Remember, Bitcoin's price history has shown that it always bounces back stronger than before.

So, rather than panic selling, consider this temporary dip as an opportunity to buy more Bitcoin at a discounted price. Stick to your investment strategy, and let time work in your favor.

What are your thoughts on this? I'd love to hear your experiences and insights.",3,2,SpaceFaceMistake,CryptoCurrency

The platform has mistakenly included ApeX, a perpetual decentralized exchange (DEX) that is explicitly forbidden (haram) under Islamic law.

2024-12-05 10:05:27,A brief contemplation of the idea of Bitcoin: A nation-state sovereign debt settlement unit,"I am imagining myself as a hard-working, tax paying citizen of small country X.

Every year, I pay taxes.

Now my government decides that maybe they should stockpile some bitcoins, because the superpower governments have started to do that, and because they heard a few success stories about how country Y freed itself from the clutches of the IMF by investing in it.

Ok, so my government buys some bitcoins. Just a little fraction of global supply, because they are expensive, and it is money coming from my taxes.

They sit on it, maybe it goes up and they can sell some to clear some other debt. Or maybe they use it as collateral to make other debts.

What they can't do, is hand it out to all of us, because ... oh well, it is extremely limited in capacity and can't be used as daily money.

So I have to be content with a portion of my wealth being invested by a trusted third party (""my"" government, haha) on my behalf. I essentially have no say over what happens to it. My government has been cyber-hacked in the past, have even lost all its citizens tax and medical records. So I am not so confident in their abilities to keep my data safe. Actually, I have friends whom I would trust more with that responsibility than my government.

But ok. Let's cross fingers and hope they somehow keep those bitcoins safe from other nation-state cyber attackers.

But then other scenarios cross my mind.

What if bad people get into my government and ""lose"" the bitcoin in some corrupt or simply stupid (gambling) scheme? Bad people get into my government from time to time, I don't seem able to stop that.

They don't even have to abscond immediately with the coins. It could be that their other policies are just so horrendous that they get chased out by a new incoming government, perhaps this even requires force. To secure themselves, the old government burns down the house and flees into exile, dispersing the national stockpile of bitcoins into their own virtual coffers before they embark the plane. There goes our taxes. This is much harder with gold or cash, though of course formerly elected or unelected have demonstrated that they are willing to try (and sometimes succeed). Bitcoin transfers are practically instant.

Come to think of it, I would sleep much better if Bitcoin were something that I stockpiled myself, instead of entrusting it to my government.

Then there is the doomsday scenarion. My country is attacked by a hostile power.

Intentionally or not, they destroy enough of my country's financial infrastructure to wipe out access to the nation's bitcoin, because it was controlled by a couple of private keys and those unfortunate individuals have been liquidated along with their possessions, in a rather unfortunate combustion incident.

Now, essentially my country has ""donated"" its Bitcoin to the void, making all other bitcoins more valuable. Specifically those of the aggressor nation that attacked us. Fuck! If only our nation's bitcoins were distributed among the people, then the people could've salvaged most of it, either by fleeing or moving it out of harm's way when the war started.

Fast forward to a future where the fate of my nation has become the fate of all smaller nations.

The last holdouts have been defeated by what one could call either the biggest global corporation or effectively the world government. Nations states are a thing of the past.

Someone owns all the remaining bitcoins looted from elsewhere, but has no-one to exchange them with, nor any reason. They can't get resources through taxing anymore, because the last satoshi has been extracted by taxes and no more were going to be mined anyway. The coins never move anymore, and nobody even bothers looking since we all have more pressing concerns about how to survive in this world. I think whoever controlled them, eventually shut down mining because it was futile in a world where there is no need to transact it. If I remember right, the media said ""shutting down the mines was better for the planet anyway"". Apparently nobody even bothered to turn it into a proof-of-stake system.

I vaguely remember the days I used bitcoins myself. Before the system was hamstrung by restricted capacity, causing high fees and the public was finally priced out of being able to use it.

Those were the days. I could still buy a pizza with it, instead of having to use this awful company scrip that I have to bust my ass off for and which only let's me buy 1 pizza per month due to global dietary controls. I suppose it's all for my own good.

It's totally possible that Peter Todd is partially behind it and he is also a CIA agent. It would definitely explain a lot of things. His reaction to questions definitely didn't give me he's telling the truth vibes.",0,5,Vegetable_Sun_9225,btc

Hello all!

Some of you may remember my original post this week in regard to my open source altcoin season website I have created. 

Original post: https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/s/hdQfMlcQA6

One of my goals was to create a telegram group so users could be notified if an indicator is met (or lost) and to get an update every morning in regard to the existing indicators status. Well it is complete and the link to the group can be found at the bottom of the website!🎉

I have also added a changelog page for things I am working on with the site. I do want to introduce some form of community voting on including requested indicators. However, those requested indicators need some form of proof that they are valuable and meaningful when it comes to the crypto market.

Link to site: https://www.thealtsignal.com

Please let me know if you have any comments or questions!

Thanks,

TheAltSignal Team

TLDR: TheAltSignal webpage now has a telegram group and a changelog page.",0,0,BugSpatula0,btc

I want to take a moment to recognize all of you—the true believers, the visionaries, and the revolutionaries. No matter what happens, I am proud to be a part of this incredible community.

When I first got involved with Bitcoin in 2011, there was so much excitement for the future—a shared dream of seizing power from the incompetent ""leaders"" of the world who care only for themselves. We had a vision of delivering freedom to everyone, regardless of their background or financial status. Bitcoin is for everyone.

Over the years, I’ve experienced so much of this journey. I was a member of /r/MTRed (Mining Team Reddit) and participated in countless conversations, debates, and battles—from the block size wars to the blatant manipulation and censorship of public forums. Through it all, my belief in this movement has never wavered. I am still as excited for the future today as I was back then.

To my friends in BCH, I want to say this: Freedom for all is still alive, and it lives on in Bitcoin Cash. I’m proud to stand alongside each of you—through thick and thin—as we continue to carry this torch. Let’s keep building and proving that Bitcoin Cash is for everyone, everywhere.

Freedom lives on in BCH!",32,13,ThatBCHGuy,btc

---

One of the reasons [cited](https://web.archive.org/web/20171211055100/https://steamcommunity.com/games/593110/announcements/detail/1464096684955433613) by big merchants for not being able to use BTC was high volatility.

This resulted in several nasties:

- Customers send bitcoin, but demand refunds of excess value if price goes up steeply in the meantime. If merchant insist that btc price is final, then customer is angry and disappointed in the payment experience / loss of value. Upset customers are not what merchants want.

- Customers send bitcoin, but bitcoin price dropped too much and merchant can't fulfil, must ask customer to pay more, causing anger, hassle, extra fees. Customer support is expensive.

- With unreliable confirmation times, chain congestion etc. this all gets much worse and can be repeated even under the best intentions from all sides, to everyone's dissatisfaction. Cryptocurrency was supposed to make things easier!

---

Bitcoin Cash also still has high volatility, but it has a giant advantage over BTC:

Users can easily and practically hedge value of payments made or received so that the volatility doesn't bite them.

This comes with extremely low network fees, so it could be done all the time until the coin's value reaches the sort of stability where people / businesses find it practically unnecessary.

[APIs](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@generalprotocols/anyhedge) and open protocols like [AnyHedge](https://anyhedge.com/) can help to make it an automatic, decentralized and transparent process.

If such hedge contracts become tokenized, eg. using CashTokens technology, then payment protocols could negotiate for payments to be made in tokens covering the necessary amount in what-ever hedged form the recipient (merchant) desires, if they don't prefer to be paid in straight in unhedged Bitcoin Cash.

---

If any of this had been possible on BTC, imagine how much more adoption there could have been by now.

__All good ideas sound obvious in hindsight.__

𓋹 _in technology adoption timeframe terms_

---

Explanation:

Until a Bitcoin chain really sees massive adoption, the block size debate is not ""settled"" - and the ""war"" is not over, no matter how money printers inflate the price of BTC.

Until BTC is massively adopted in real life, and not just in fake news - we will not be able to see what measures it takes w.r.t. the block size. No argument I've seen can explain away the need for substantial block space increases on L1, except ""You shouldn't use Bitcoin for payments, use /fiat/crypto banks/...""

L2's won't work reliably without L1 capacity.

If BCH sees adoption, it will easily win the block size war debate. We already know that larger blocks are not a technical issue, it's been proven. That truth has been suppressed by censorship and a misinformation campaign against on chain scaling.

The real winners of the blocksize wars _so far_? Other coins, like ETH, SOL, XRP. One has to start asking difficult questions about motive.

The demand for transaction capacity has moved to such other coins, which incidentally often provide other features like more powerful programmability than BTC.

But the important point is they have essentially proven that they can handle that demand and scale - even if sometimes with bumps and fits. Technically Bitcoin could and should learn from them. There is not much rocket science involved there.

At the _very least_, the broader picture is one of defeat for the central argument of the ""small blocker"" faction who were in favor of strictly limited capacity, which was that bigger blocks would realistically be harmful to the blockchain.",51,23,LovelyDayHere,btc

Traders should stay informed, as these shifts could signal opportunities.

Exchanges among other large market players have maximized these movements as seen in the likes of Bitget which is currently running campaigns aligned with trending coins. For instance, you can trade BTC, DOGE, and more to share in a pool of 400,000 DOGE airdrops.

---

Circulating supply is something like 19,790,568 / 21,000,000 , or 94.241% .

About 5.759% remaining to be issued (mined) over the next decades unless BTC developers change the issuance schedule / maximum coin supply.

_These numbers don't tell us what is going to happen in the future._

_But they do tell us something about the world today._

__Bitcoin as an asset is concentrated in very few hands.__

What if we distribute the remaining 5.759% only to those 99.875% of the world who do not hold any substantial amounts in BTC today ... ? Would that improve things?

Let's do that math.

99.875% of (8B - 5M^* people) = 7,995,000,000 people x 0.99875 = 7,985,006,250 people (who currently hold no substantial BTC)

5.759% of (21M - 19,790,568) bitcoins = 1,209,432 bitcoins

How much would each of those new holders be able to get if it were somehow magically distributed equally^+ ?

_(whips out calculator)_

1,209,432 bitcoin / 7,985,006,250 people = 0.00015146287 BTC / person

How much is that per person in today's prices? (let's use $100K / BTC to be generous)

That is __$15.15__ (rounded up).

I think you can see that it's not going to make an appreciable dent in their lifetimes. Even if it goes up in price x 10. __In short, it wouldn't be able to make an appreciable portion of humanity into significant holders of BTC as a ""store of value""__. And that is purely from the cold hard, mathematical facts of Bitcoin supply as we know them. I'm not even going to speculate on whether it's practical to own $15 worth of bitcoins in the future when today's BTC apostles already warn that withdrawing less than $1000 into self-custody might end you up with losing a large amount of it to network fees in future, or getting funds stuck completely (dust).

The only thing that could achieve _making an appreciable portion of humanity into significant holders of BTC as a ""store of value""_, is some type of redistribution (I'm not saying it has to be forced or otherwise under terms of non-voluntary exchange) from the existing BTC wealth holders to a significant part of the rest of humanity.

And that's not going to happen without A LOT OF EXCHANGE.

__Which is why Bitcoin would need to become a very good medium of exchange__, if it's going to be able to distribute that wealth around to _become a true reserve currency_.

&nbsp;

_UNTIL WE MEET AGAIN_

&nbsp;

^(REMEMBER YOU ARE ALWAYS WELCOME TO POINT OUT WHERE YOU THINK I'M WRONG)

(*) minus the ~ 5M who hold some substantial amount  ($10K or above in today's dollars)

(+) equal distribution is of course wishful thinking for all we know, in practice those who already own a lot have ways to accumulate faster, and this just means the real distribution will be skewed towards them and not to today's have-nots, and has even less chance of making a significant dent in people's ""store of value"" determinations.",0,37,LovelyDayHere,btc

# UX improvements:

\- It's now possible to add a **system prompt** (for all models except Claude/Gemini ones)

\- There's a **dark/light mode switch** next to new chat

\- **Export chats** as PDF or Markdown by appending ?export=pdf or =md to the URL

\- ALT + C for new chat, ALT + I for new image (Option C and Option I on Mac)

# New models:

\- **Qwen QwQ 32b** is Alibaba's answer to OpenAI's o1-preview. It ""thinks"", and only starts outputting later.

\- OpenAI and Google released about 4 **new versions of ChatGPT/Gemini**, to constantly overtake each other on the leaderboards (we immediately push their newest version live every time). Google also released LearnLM, a model focused specifically on helping people learn new skills, which of course we added.

\- Alibaba's **Qwen Max, Qwen Large, Qwen Long and Qwen Turbo** have been added, very low prices and up to 10m token context. Almost no other provider offers these models.

\- **Step-2-16k**, another Chinese model, is also pretty much only available through us. It scores extremely well on the LiveBench comparison, and is very popular in China.

\- **Mistral Large** and a *ton* of open-source models got added. These include many Roleplay/Storytelling models (more on that below) and **two ""abliterated"" models**, versions of models that have been finetuned to remove limitations and biases. They're uncensored versions, essentially.

# Cool integrations:

\- **SillyTavern** is an open-source front-end that many people use for roleplaying. Dylan was kind enough to do a pull request and add us in, so we're now natively supported and suddenly have a lot more users that are interested in roleplaying models, hence also the additions.

\- **""battleofcoins.com""** lets you pick crypto, pick models, and have the AIs discuss and debate which one is best over multiple rounds. Very fun implementation, you can pick any selection criteria you want.

# More:

\- We added lots of additional payment methods: **Binance Pay, Coinbase Wallet**, ETH + L2s, and a lot more. This is likely the last additions we did for a while there, since anything else feels like diminishing returns.

\- We released **payment stats** on how much the different crypto were used. I'll add this into a comment because I'm afraid links will get the post removed. **Bitcoin Cash** adds up to 6.1% of the volume with 3.0% of the transaction count. Bitcoin Cash was one of our first additions and we see usage of it growing, but usage on other chains is currently growing faster.



Also important for many of you: we have a working branch with file uploads. It can take excel files, pdfs, documents etc. We want to release it as soon as possible but it's also a change that needs quite a bit of testing, so we don't want to push it too soon and get people annoyed at how badly it works.

--- 
BTC folks claim it must be a store of value first, then later it can become a medium of exchange.

They claim that BCH is trying to go about it the wrong way, by wanting to start as a medium of exchange.

__So, what is stopping BTC from becoming useful as a medium of exchange, like BCH?__

Isn't BTC already a store of value, so now it's high time to move on to becoming a medium of exchange?

In 2017, Steam answered this question (for themselves, and at that time) by saying ""high fees and volatility in the value of Bitcoin"".

For those interested in [the longer version](https://web.archive.org/web/20171211055100/https://steamcommunity.com/games/593110/announcements/detail/1464096684955433613):

> In the past few months we've seen an increase in the volatility in the value of Bitcoin and a significant increase in the fees to process transactions on the Bitcoin network. For example, transaction fees that are charged to the customer by the Bitcoin network have skyrocketed this year, topping out at close to $20 a transaction last week (compared to roughly $0.20 when we initially enabled Bitcoin). Unfortunately, Valve has no control over the amount of the fee. These fees result in unreasonably high costs for purchasing games when paying with Bitcoin. The high transaction fees cause even greater problems when the value of Bitcoin itself drops dramatically.

> Historically, the value of Bitcoin has been volatile, but the degree of volatility has become extreme in the last few months, losing as much as 25% in value over a period of days. This creates a problem for customers trying to purchase games with Bitcoin. When checking out on Steam, a customer will transfer x amount of Bitcoin for the cost of the game, plus y amount of Bitcoin to cover the transaction fee charged by the Bitcoin network. The value of Bitcoin is only guaranteed for a certain period of time so if the transaction doesn’t complete within that window of time, then the amount of Bitcoin needed to cover the transaction can change. The amount it can change has been increasing recently to a point where it can be significantly different.

> The normal resolution for this is to either refund the original payment to the user, or ask the user to transfer additional funds to cover the remaining balance. In both these cases, the user is hit with the Bitcoin network transaction fee again. This year, we’ve seen increasing number of customers get into this state. With the transaction fee being so high right now, it is not feasible to refund or ask the customer to transfer the missing balance (which itself runs the risk of underpayment again, depending on how much the value of Bitcoin changes while the Bitcoin network processes the additional transfer).

> At this point, it has become untenable to support Bitcoin as a payment option. We may re-evaluate whether Bitcoin makes sense for us and for the Steam community at a later date.",18,24,LovelyDayHere,btc

__Why am I making this long post? Because the AMA contained an announcement of a further release of info around Xmas. They will keep pushing something. Real Satoshi if alive would not publish some new tech under the Satoshi identity without real signature proof, if he wanted to take a stance against all existing blockchain tech.__

---

Let's have a brief look at the AMA narrative:

This one's story one ticks all the Tony Stark patriotic boxes.

Lone inventor, genius, disappointed with all of crypto but still working on the thing which should replace it all.

Disagrees with original Satoshi on:

- open source needed
- blockchain is no longer the answer, but some yet unreleased miracle tech which isn't going to be open source
- ""Changing the block size made sense on the technical level but would kill public confidence in the network once the public understood anything could be changed"" - the second portion of this btw is a long time Core narrative

Further 

- claims that SN left a signed Twitter message which hasn't been seen by many, but when challenged to link to it, refuses to do so
- grants that ""the Satoshi 'email' during the block wars that tipped things in favor of small blocks wasn’t me"" - as if we didn't know it was fake from the incomplete email headers
- claims BCH made an ""ethically poor choice"" in allegedly ""doubling the supply to legacy wallets and transactions instead of creating a new genesis block and new supply"" - doesn't discuss how a new supply would be problematic because disenfranchises existing holders instead of acting like a share split
- claims ""one faction lost the block size wars"" and big blockers should've ""accepted that decision and let it go"" -- while there was no clear ""decision"" when BCH split - and a permissionless blockchain cannot be stopped once it is going. If anything the market is still weighing the outcome today and will continue to do so in the future...
- ""Bitcoin cash created a market cap that they weren’t entitled to by using the existing blockchain which is ethically questionable"" - seems more like a Max Keiser narrative. Bitcoin is permissionless, long term holders were dissatisfied with the non-scaling (obvious sabotage at that point), and it would be ethically questionable not to fight the takeover by what the random anon account claims to be in line with the historical records of ""Hijacking Bitcoin"".
- ""They should have made a new product and a new genesis block with a completely different name"" -- we are to believe that this Satoshi sat on the sidelines and could post a signed message to Twitter but couldn't put forth his opinion on the fork prior to it or immediately after it happened, or get in touch with the big blockers to let him know how he felt about it. /s
- ""The quest for monetary gain and power goes against everything I stand for."" - this is another common BTC maxi / Core narrative against Bitcoin Cash, that it was done out of some ulterior and dirty motive to profit. People should really read ""Hijacking Bitcoin"" instead of believing these tales.

When invited to publish cryptographic proof, either via the old Twitter message (probably non-existent or a feint from some other key not conclusively linked to SN) or to post a new signed message with some believable credentials on r/btc or elsewhere, the proxy account pulls a Craig Wright like response:

> You, and everyone else will likely find a way to say an original cryptographic signature is somehow “not real”

If there were the real SN behind this, they wouldn't put out such a lame excuse.

Claims we have a Christmas day whitepaper release to look forward to, about the new non-blockchain miracle tech.

So watch out. Fake shit probably incoming.

""Do not trust, verify."" Keep asking for proof, keep asking hard questions.

This has all the markings of a new anti-""crypto"", but here's-my-proprietary-new-financial system campaign.

You _know_ who would like to see that happen.

Anyway, I was investigating old POW coins and discovered a coin with huge discrepancy between market cap and liquidity. Usually when liquidity dries up, price and market cap plummets. 

Mooncoin has around 230 Billion with a market cap of $222 million. Yet it only has two exchanges. Coingecko doesn't even list it. CMC shows next to nothing about it.

The first exchange is Finexbox which is a scam exchange. Even that only has just over $60 liquidity on sells before zero price is reached.

The second exchange is Cointopay with a total sell depth of just under 94 Dogecoin or about $40. 

This is it. You could own 1% of all the Mooncoin (supposedly worth $2.22 million), but would be unable to get more than $100 selling any portion of it.

I have seen much healthier coins with market caps under a $million.

2024-11-30 22:45:13,SHIBCH: The Memecoin Revolution on Bitcoin Cash – Accessible for Everyone.,"[Join us on X. @ShibOnBCH](https://preview.redd.it/5roxi98da44e1.jpg?width=640&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=c3523748ce630125871968739c40ebd29289747a)

  
**Introduction**  
In the ever-evolving world of cryptocurrency, memecoins have carved out a unique niche. SHIBCH stands out not just as another token but as a memecoin built on the robust foundation of Bitcoin Cash (BCH) and powered by the innovative CashTokens protocol. SHIBCH proves that crypto can be inclusive, functional, and fun, enabling users to participate in the ecosystem regardless of their financial standing.

**Why SHIBCH?**  
SHIBCH isn’t just a memecoin—it’s a statement of what’s possible with the “version of Bitcoin that works.” Bitcoin Cash, with its scalable network and minimal fees, ensures that SHIBCH transactions are practical for everyone. Whether you're a crypto whale or just starting with $0.01, SHIBCH is designed to be accessible.

With Bitcoin Cash's low fees, you can test the power of SHIBCH without worrying about breaking the bank. Want to see for yourself? Try the network with as little as $1—or even just $0.01! Economic transactions that are unfeasible on many other blockchains are entirely possible with Bitcoin Cash, making SHIBCH a truly inclusive project.

**No Money? No Problem!**  
Bitcoin Cash's ecosystem extends opportunities to those with no initial capital. Platforms like [CashRain.com](https://cashrain.com/) allow users to earn free BCH by participating in community activities. This free BCH can then be used to buy tokens like SHIBCH, allowing you to dip your toes into the crypto world without spending a dime.

**What Are CashTokens?**  
The secret sauce behind SHIBCH lies in the CashTokens protocol. CashTokens enable the creation of tokens on the Bitcoin Cash blockchain, giving rise to projects like SHIBCH. With CashTokens, users enjoy fast, low-cost transactions, making it the perfect platform for memecoins and other decentralized finance (DeFi) applications.

**Why Bitcoin Cash?**  
Bitcoin Cash delivers on the original vision of Bitcoin as peer-to-peer electronic cash. Its low transaction fees, fast processing times, and scalable infrastructure make it the ideal blockchain for SHIBCH. Unlike other networks where high fees and slow transactions can discourage smaller investors, Bitcoin Cash welcomes users of all economic backgrounds.

**Investing in SHIBCH**  
Buying SHIBCH is as simple as using platforms like TapSwap or CauldronSwap. Even if your net worth is just $0.01, you can participate in the SHIBCH economy. The token embodies the inclusivity and accessibility that Bitcoin Cash brings to the crypto space, making it a perfect gateway for new users to explore the power of decentralized finance.

**Conclusion**  
SHIBCH is more than just a memecoin; it's a movement that demonstrates the potential of Bitcoin Cash and CashTokens. Whether you have $1, $0.01, or just your time, SHIBCH and the Bitcoin Cash ecosystem invite you to participate, engage, and experience the future of cryptocurrency.

Take the first step today. Test the network, earn free BCH, and join the SHIBCH community. The version of Bitcoin that works is waiting for you!",0,0,francis105d1,btc

2024-11-30 14:49:19,"You could restart an entire Bitcoin network from a UTXO commitment. Running a full node to ""validate all transactions"" trustlessly is totally unnecessary.","As per the flair: This is my OPINION.

But I heartily invite contrary views.

Make your best argument for why home users should need to run a node that stores all blocks.

There's a great way to ensure that the entire history's block data remains economically decentralized. It's called Fountain Codes.

https://arxiv.org/pdf/1906.12140v1.pdf

If history is anything to go by, this will probably be widely adopted on Bitcoin Cash before you see something like it in Bitcoin Core (which frankly, will never need it because they don't plan to scale L1).

Apart from that, if you're only running a node because you want to help validate the network's consensus (i.e. ""keep the system honest""), then you can also just run a pruned node today, with sufficient backlog of blocks (maybe 5% of history?). Bitcoin chains will never do massive deep-reorgs without there being a great consensus crisis (like there was during ETH/ETC split).

Bitcoin transactions are essentially immutable once they're buried a few blocks deep in the chain.

Chains that don't have as much hashrate as BTC yet, like BCH, can protect themselves against hostile deep reorg attacks, by considering blocks of a certain depth as no-longer-reorganizable. In practice this seems to work.

As long as you update your client software, you can validate current consensus on any such chains at very low cost - in a pruned way.

And in future, with UTXO commitments, you'll be able to sync them up in a jiffy too.

So there you go. My opinion is that decentralization is not at risk through on chain scaling. The tech to mitigate this all exists.

Just adjust the factors to 38x or 130x.

&nbsp;

On a network with adequate capacity engineering, transaction capacity (supply) remains above demand, thus as the unit price of the coin rises, the fees rise linearly (†). [The relationship between price and fees on a network like BTC where blockspace supply is not kept above demand, is not linear](https://bitinfocharts.com/comparison/transactionfees-btc-bch.html#alltime)...

I am myself interested to better understand the nature of this relationship, but I know it's some type of bursty, explosive and hard-to-accurately-predict affair. _Reminds me of a car exhaust, stuttering just before it back-fires. Normally a sign that the car has to go into the workshop for maintenance._

It's not just that your coins aren't yours when they're on a centralized exchange.

If you use a blockchain that is permissioned, even after you withdraw your money from the exchange, your future transactions can be refused even when you make them from a self custody wallet.

_That's not the Magic Internet Money you want._

Inform yourselves on which coins/tokens are permissioned and which aren't. A bit of research can mean the difference between being able to spend your money later as you see fit, or not.

2024-11-29 15:54:20,What is your profit taking plan? Here is the tool that will tell you what it should be ,"Hey everyone!

For me (have been here since 2016), nothing is worse than realizing you could have increased your holdings by selling when you sensed the market was peaking.

That's why I created [kollit.ai](http://kollit.ai) ! I am super excited to share it with you and hear what you think. It is a personal project that's been in the works for over 6 months. Around a year ago, as I prepared myself for the upcoming (inevitable) bull run, I wanted to figure out the best way to take profits to prepare myself for the next (also inevitable)  bear market. Obviously, I'm not interested in selling all my holdings, nor do I want to DCA out. While DCA works okay, it doesn't quite capture my specific wants and needs.

It's a (free with paid options) tool that helps you craft your perfect profit-taking (and market entry) strategy, based on **your** market outlook and predictions.

So, how does it work? It minimizes ""regret""—both the regret of action (""Fuck, I shouldn't have sold at that price"") and the regret of inaction (""Should've sold when I had the chance""). My algorithm balances these two regrets to output a strategy that fits you perfectly.

Getting started is easy:

* Visit the landing page to understand if this tool fits your needs
* Enter **5 price points** for each asset you want a strategy for
* Play around with a few parameters like **risk tolerance** and **execution pace**
* And you're all set!

I'm just wrapping up the closed alpha stage and opening registration to everyone. For now, I'm allowing a few dozen people each day to keep things smooth and make sure everything works.

I'm also thrilled to introduce a new feature that wasn't in the alpha—**Wisdom of the Crowd**. You can now check the asset page to see how many active predictions each asset has, and when an asset reaches over 100 active predictions, you can harness the collective insights to give your strategy an extra boost!

As a launch promotion, every new user gets **12 extra free tokens** \+ **1 token for each month** they log in :)

I'm a solo dev and poured my heart into this, using every spare moment I had. Maintaining this project costs over $60 a month (thanks to machine learning and all the calculations), so if you like what you see, I'd really appreciate it if you'd consider buying a token package :)

Currently it is **not** mobile friendly, sorry for the inconvenience, I will start working on it

**New Features:**

* Added Google authentication (if you encounter an /auth/auth-code-error, try replacing it with /dashboard)
* New landing page to better understand the tool's capabilities

**For those siging up without google:** I ask for birthdate, name and country in the signup. The birthdate is for legal reasons, verify that you are over 18. The name is for the avatar and notification emails in the future, and country is for me, if you want to keep it private just put another country as you can also use a made up name.

NAIL-BITER.","At midnight tonight (US/EST, GMT-5) Friday November 29th, the fundraiser for the Future BCH Electron Cash Plugin is scheduled to expire. Whomp Whomp.

# TL;DR: TOO LONG TO READ?; DON'T DONATE. You're good.

There's lots of ways to get people's coins. It will be much easier for me to get your coins if you don't read this.

Unfortunately, I need to say some blunt and, perhaps, unpopular things to save some fortunes today. None of which should be taken personally by anyone building products and shipping software.

There's a lot of difficult and good work being done in Bitcoin Cash DeFi, but the things separating users from their coins keep getting shilled, while ideas paying dividends keep getting NACKered by the same actors.

The idea for Future BCH proposal was written because there wasn't enough time to explain it in the first and only non-X-spaces General Protocols Space. 

FBCH also owes a debt to Dagur Valberg Johannsson, as the Vault is an extension of his WBCH idea. 

I also have a tremendous amount of respect for people like Jonald Fyookball, who have been consistently in Bitcoin Cash from the beginning, but unfortunately I'm also a bag of meat that has to eat.

None of the below should be taken personally, we have business to get done, and we need to reshuffle some liquidity and thinking.

## Do not donate if you're a permabull headed up the ramp to nowhere.

Right now, there is still a very limited range of native instruments in Bitcoin Cash DeFi. One of them has way more total locked value than all the others combined.

In a healthy system of markets, a short-term instrument to speculate with leverage can be a vital and useful tool *if* people also have the same access to *fair* primary markets. But it's a tool to harvest money when it's the only native instrument to gain exposure to the broader markets. 

In a real market, assets are swapped between parties and the trading of possession affects the price. But if the trade never goes to market, that's called something else.

If someone believes the price from a cryptocurrency oracle is fair and free from manipulation in 2024, and they want to enter into a succession of large bullish positions in contracts where only bulls can be slaughtered and hedges are never liquidated―that's okay, it's actually great. 

I don't want a small donation from someone that can't stop from getting successively liquidated, I'd like ALL their coins. And when their coins are harvested, they'll be put back on the market to create a lower more erratic bart-wave for us all. And that keeps me working for lots of cheap coins longer. 

So disconnected speculators are creating low prices and maximizing my employment, which was brilliant as monetary policy. 

Anyone can pick up an unplugged controller after placing their coins in a bucket. They can await word from the oracle on their fate. The criers that shuffled them into the shop will give them some memes for their troubles on the way out. 

There is a real place for leveraged swaps; but hopefully not fifteen times all the other native BCH defi combined. IMHO.

## Do NOT donate if you like dollars and are excited to go back into a petro dollar cave.

If someone is given a gold coin, and their first question is how to trade it for real sea-shells, they're going to be relived of that coin fairly certainly and quickly. 

Their coin will go forward into the future just fine without a sales pitch. 

Without fair and stable price discovery, most USD oracle based swap contracts are just going to feed the liquidity harvesting bart-saw. 

It's disingenuous to imply one party does not have perfect unilateral control over a price oracle when an infinite amount of dollar tokens can be printed at will outside Bitcoin Cash.

A fiat price oracle could be fair, it could be great, if we could also have infinite leverage on liquidity on our side to match the other side's infinite liquidity.

## Sad statements from one of our founders.

Jonald Fyookball, a Founder of the Bitcoin Cash project and a Lead Developer of the Electron Cash wallet has also stated publicly, in response to the plugin flipstarter announcement on telegram, that the entire Future BCH ecosystem is not viable without some source of revenue for the coupons used on the primary swap markets. 

To paraphrase his view, he believes that prior to a FBCH plugin for his wallet, there should be a different project built, one that can supply a reliable stream of revenue for coupons, perhaps related to online advertising.

PLEASE DON'T GIVE ME MONEY if you can look at an address with a steady stream of regular payments and ask ""but where's the revenue?"", a blockchain is useless because a single source of truth is gone―we have no currency. 

If people can look at an app where 100% of the users have more value, and gotten their dividend every month, and *everyone* hodls atop a fairly sick pile of gains, and then not get the point of the app, then the Futures probably aren't for them either. 

Better luck with a DeFi app instead. None of my apps can help.

## The final pitch for a future money plugin

My Dear reader, my user, my financiers,

I'm standing in front of 30 powerful markets.

The markets were proposed, the community paid for them. They are ALL YOURS. And they're moving, and they are gonna get moving huge, fast.

The markets are always on, no limits, no permissions, no circuit breaks, no halts, all gas, no fuggin' breaks.

There are NO ORACLES. NO DOLLARS. NO MEMES. NO NFTS (that you can buy). The only currencies are bitcoin and time.

I'm offering you a free permanent desk, a clean pressed suit, a sharp pair of visors, a terminal, the secret manuals, free charts, a walled garden to write your first successful python trading bots.

I'm standing in front of *The Room Where It Happens*, and I'm beckoning you to come up from the gutter of endless crypto scams. 

I want to hear YOUR voice in the market. I want you to take rates, I want you to set the rates for GOOD money. I want to sit in perfect silence as the markets roar and flip and new waves of markets are born.

Yeah, yeah, yeah, you can make money with the plugin. You can make your bones or build an empire. You can also command whales and feed the guppies. I'm offering you POWER―an incredible amount of RAW unstoppable power.

There are new oracles to make. There are new beautiful machines to build. 

There are continents to move, there is still a world worth saving. 

Just give me 0.01 BCH; give me 0.001 BCH. The amount doesn't matter, the plugin will still be built if the campaign fails. Try not to fund it to completion. Don't end the suspense. [BUT CLICK HERE TO DONATE](https://flipstarter.futurebitcoin.cash/en)

Just send a `pong` for my `ping`; an ACK for an ACK. That's all I want. Just tell me you read this. That you heard this. 

Anyone can have their name written in the credits of history, today.

I don't need NACKs sats, but those can be recorded too. 

If we're too afraid to have and use sats, to ping and pong, to speak our opinions, then we already lost everything and no amount of bitcoin or technology can save us.",14,26,2q_x,btc

2024-11-28 15:14:14,Putting your coins into someone else's custody means you also lose your most direct input to their governance,"I read the description of one ETF just now, and to quote from it:

> Pursuant to the terms of the Trust Agreement, the Trust has disclaimed ownership in any such IR [ed: fork or airdrop] Assets and/or Incidental Rights to make clear that such assets are not and shall never be considered assets of the Trust and will not be taken into account for purposes of determining the Trust’s NAV or NAV per Share.

Not only would you as participant in this scheme NOT own the real underlying assets.

It seems you would lose a meaningful power of governance in influencing the development direction of the assets.

---

Owning the underlying asset directly (i.e. through self-custody) would enable you to dispose of any forks or airdrops as you see fit:

- you could decide to sell one side of a split and re-invest that in the other
- you could decide to keep both as a _valuable_ part of your portfolio and see how they develop, postponing future buy/sell decisions
- you could even decide to get rid of both sides of a split and get out the full market value of both at that time

See how this differs from the position you're in with a custodian that owns assets but disowns potential coin splits?

To the extent that people delegate their wealth to ETFs and such, they weaken their own power to make important governance decision and timeously^1 determine what is valuable and what is not.

Food for thought.

Trading volume in U.S. spot exchange traded funds (ETFs) hit a six-month high of $3.3 billion on Oct. 29, according to Eric Balchunas, ETF market analyst at Blooomberg. Bitcoin added 4% during the U.S. trading session, and volume spikes in ETFs are more typical of crisis situations and market crashes, he said. At the same time, the situation can change if investors are gripped by lost-money syndrome (FOMO), Balchunas added.

According to the results of trading on October 29, the group of spot bitcoin-ETFs received $870 million of new capital - the third largest daily inflow since their launch in January. BlackRock's IBIT fund received the most investor funds ($642 million).

The spot ETFs have $72.55 billion worth of bitcoins under management - 5.07% of existing coins.

The bitcoin exchange rate on Oct. 29 at around 10 p.m. approached the record high of $73,777 recorded on Binance on March 14, but corrected below $72,000 after reaching $73,620.

Some other highlights:

“Lutnick restricted the number of employees who had contact with Tether to a handful of top executives.”

The CEO Devasini has flown to meet with Lutnick in Bukele’s El Salvador, where Tether’s partner exchange Bitfinex is also serving as something like an investment bank helping companies raise capital (or trying to - so far the capital raises facilitated by Bitfinex have mostly been flops).

“Devasini, an Italian who has refused to travel to the U.S. for fear of arrest, according to some business associates, sees Lutnick as a shield against the efforts of American authorities and rivals to disrupt his lucrative business.”

Lutnick’s son Brandon Lutnick had an internship with Tether in 2023 in the Swiss town of Lugano.

The United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime branded the stablecoin a “preferred choice” for money launderers in a report.

2024-11-27 12:28:01,"""Not Your Keys, Not Your Coins"" has gone to die on BTC. But just how dead is it? Open questions.","[There are solid indications that at most 15% of BTC ""owners"" are holding self-custodially, and the percentage is likely to be even lower.](https://www.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/1h0nwvh/btcers_owning_coins_proportion_of_selfcustody_vs/)

In other words __85% (though likely more) are only using the system CUSTODIALLY__. Through a financial institution.

In my humble opinion this represents a catastrophic situation of capture and defeat of the principle of trustless transacting as laid out in the beginning of the system:

> Commerce on the Internet has come to rely almost exclusively on financial institutions serving as trusted third parties to process electronic payments. While the system works well enough for most transactions, it still suffers from the inherent weaknesses of the trust based model. Completely non-reversible transactions are not really possible, since financial institutions cannot
avoid mediating disputes. The cost of mediation increases transaction costs, limiting the minimum practical transaction size and cutting off the possibility for small casual transactions, and there is a broader cost in the loss of ability to make non-reversible payments for non-reversible services. With the possibility of reversal, the need for trust spreads. __Merchants must be wary of their customers, hassling them for more information than they would otherwise need.__
A certain percentage of fraud is accepted as unavoidable. These costs and payment uncertainties can be avoided in person by using physical currency, but no mechanism exists to make payments over a communications channel without a trusted party.

TL;DR bitcoiners on BTC are almost back to square one - before bitcoin was a thing - in terms of the need to use intermediaries, with all the downsides of that, right up to potential currency debasement.

The bolded part is mine, and relates in part to pervasive KYC/AML that users are being hassled about, sometimes even thought the merchant doesn't want it but is being forced to do (via regulation).

> What is needed is an electronic payment system based on cryptographic proof instead of trust, allowing any two willing parties to transact directly with each other without the need for a trusted third party.

That's Satoshi saying: people need to be empowered to have custody over their own money and transact directly with it, without a financial institutions. _That's_ what Bitcoin was invented to solve. That's what is lost when you go custodial.

Less need for trust, less need for intermediaries, less risk, less costs to you, less hassle for you.

---

My first open question relates to:

- __On average how many addresses does a self-custodial user control?__

Knowing this would allow the accuracy of the estimate of number of self-custodial users to be significantly refined.

After all, it would be nice knowing if the real-world percentage of custodial users is as low as 85% or more like 99%.

The best source of such statistical data on number of addresses per real, self-custodial user, is probably companies which deal with real world users in a custodial way. i.e. Exchanges, non-custodial wallet app companies whose backends have some idea on number of address requests per user etc.

It is likely that at this point, the self-custodial users are a dwindling population that originally held out for the attraction of a decentralized, trustless, permissionless monetary system described in the Bitcoin whitepaper. Plus a couple of hodlers who might really transfer to very few cold storage addresses.

Anyway, hope to get some feedback on what you think about my open question re: the average number of addresses per self-custodying user.

My average hashrate was 25,000-30,000 Ghash/s Estimated difficulty at that time was 1e08. Btc was about $300/coin And I probably ran it for a total of about 12-24 hours, although 10 years later my memory may fail me.

I used a program called BTCDig. I was able to locate a forum on bitcointalk.org about them, and the owner (dbitcoin) hasn’t been active since 2016. BTCDig.com is no longer active, and the support email is now disconnected (I sent many emails).

My questions are:

- is it possible that the btc were cloud stored, because if it was on my old hard drive… its gone.
- does anyone have any info on BTCDig or CGminer/BFGminer (what I used to mine) and could help me try to locate the program?
- given those parameters… how much BTC is it likely that I had?

2024-11-26 21:52:11,"BTC'ers ""owning"" coins: proportion of self-custody vs. custodial or owning ""shares""","I am going to take some numbers put out by Dan Morehead, of Pantera Capital, as one of the starting points of this train of thought track.

The numbers (according to Dan):

> [""50 million people in the US own it, 300 million people globally.""](https://youtu.be/iKbUw6qQXvM)

Open a tab to take a look at this very helpful site:

https://bitinfocharts.com/top-100-richest-bitcoin-addresses.html

Sum the 'Addresses' numbers to get to the total number of addresses holding funds on Bitcoin:

At the time of making this post, I get:

6071334+11203791+13090972+11597408+8023935+3504198+845569+134821+14640+1990+93+4 = 54488755

In other words about ~ 54.5M addresses.

So, by Dan's rough numbers (which I'm sure are smartly informed), these 54.5M addresses must cover ~ 50M + 300M = ~ 350M ""owners of bitcoins"" in the US + the rest of the world, combined.

Now, we know that self-custody is only possible if you hold your coins on at least one address that you control via its private key. _""Your keys, your coins.""_

So the total number of _self-custodial_ holders _in the entire world_ can be _at most_ 54.5M, in fact it'll be appreciably lower because few people have only one address - as you transact using your own wallet, it usually generates multiple addresses for things like change or receiving amounts from people making payments to you.

Logically, people ""owning bitcoin"" referred to by Dan must necessarily include those owning it non-custodially (although I don't know precisely how expansive a definition he applied).

Due to the ""_at most_"" limiting factor above implied by the total number of addresses known in the Bitcoin (BTC) system at this time, we can conclude that, if the ""ownership numbers"" are serious and relate to people actually owning bitcoins by either self-custody or in custody of others (like professional custodial services), then -

__Only >>>at most<<< ~ 15% of owners are keeping their coins in self custody__. I repeat, tops. Maximally. Probably way less.

__That would imply at least 6 in every 7 users are entrusting their coins to someone else.__ Probably more.

This does not shock me, given the pivot in Bitcoin's official narrative to ""store of value"" and multi-front efforts to promote keeping bitcoins in the custody of financial institutions (*), for whatever reasons (safekeeping, lending against fiat or other coins, speculation etc).

Since this post is meant to be a discussion:

_I am looking for data that corroborates or counters the numbers put out by Dan, to get a feel for how accurate the proportion is. And tell me what you think about it._

The blockchain data alone doesn't tell us this, since one person can and often does have multiple addresses, and some addresses, e.g. some exchange addresses or cold storage vaults, are also technically shared by multiple ""owners"" of the coins, although this is at best reflected by legal agreements and not enforceable on chain as many of owners have experienced when exchanges or (neo)banks went bust.

2024-11-26 17:08:59,"Game-plan for how large financial institutions will manipulate the price of BTC up to $1,000,000! ","Step by step guide for large financial institutions like Blackrock to manipulate Bitcoin: 

1. Pay developers a lot of money to maintain the Bitcoin protocol in a way that discourages everyday peer to peer cash trading (as was intended) and instead encourage holding onto it for extended periods of time. This can be done by keeping transaction fees relatively high. 
2. Pay people to be gate keepers of the narrative on social media and squash dissenting opinions. Overall you want to keep Bitcoin holders happy with the price going up. Making belief it is the only true signal of Bitcoin being successful. It’s important to measure Bitcoin’s success by market cap rather than utility as peer to peer cash (as white paper eludes to). After all, who doesn’t love to make money? 
3. Have large financial institutions own a majority stake in Miners, to have an influence in the protocol. This will ultimately euthanize Bitcoin so that it can’t ever come close to competing against the banks as being the middleman in financial transactions. 
4. Have ETFs to encourage people to not actually hold keys to their own Bitcoin, but instead have exposure through ETF. This ensures that Bitcoin will not give you the financial freedom that was intended. Additionally it is easier to obfuscate BTC holdings in the ETF. 
5. Most importantly, create wild booms and busts of the price to shake out weak hands and get an even greater share of the market cap. Artificially create bull runs by using billions to buy Bitcoin so that it can run from $7,000 to $62,000. Watch the plebes, that are in it to make a lot of money, buy in at $60,000 because they don’t want to miss out. Then sell billions in a matter of days and buy it in an alternate account to create a bear market. This way the BTC holdings can be kept while bringing the price down to $16,000. On the way down buy up the holdings of plebes with weak hands who bought it at $60k and now are selling at a $42,000 discount. Then just keep doing that over and over to discourage and price people out until you hold a significant market share. We are seeing this play out right now 😬. 

This is why I still hold BTC, because it is manipulated by large institutions and it is going to go keep moonshoting in price. We haven’t even seen nothing yet. There is a lot of money to be made here. I wouldn’t be surprised if we saw $1 million BTC soon. However, this is also why I diversify with Bitcoin Cash, who actually holds true to the original intent of Bitcoin. 

What are the next steps for these institutions? 🤔 Since they own a majority share of the miners, they can then use that to get the developers to fork over to a new protocol that is eco friendly. Because it is more healthy for the environment to do proof of stake than proof of work. At that point it is check mate because doing POS will benefit the majority stakeholders of BTC; which are these large institutions.

[Bitcoin](https://www.bitcoin.com/bitcoin.pdf) showed the _potential_.

But for this potential to be realized, we have to remain in contact with the ground. Don't be fooled by talk about the moon when your money isn't yet widely accepted or even usable on much of earth. Unless you plan on leaving to the Moon or Mars imminently and plan to establish an economy there based on 7 transactions per second, it'll take something more than BTC.

It should also be obvious to the _intelligent rich people who own most bitcoins_ [[2]](https://www.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/1gx5i34/an_examination_of_claims_of_btc_adoption_based_on/), that 

- if Bitcoin is not successful in _your country_ or at least the countries you spend most time in, then it won't be of much use to you there, it won't be ""money"" for you and eventually it'll migrate out of your pocket to some place where it is used.

- if Bitcoin use becomes concentrated only in a small set of countries, the rest of the world will use its own counterweight currencies (possibly also instances of hard money) and if you want to do business there or live there, you will need to use other currencies as well, which means inevitable friction and loss due to middlemen. I know, I bet this cost of business will always exist somewhere. But if a true global reserve currency would emerge from a p2p cash system, it could be used practically everywhere. All I'm saying is: the maximal success case for Bitcoin would be to achieve this status: That you can use it everywhere, and that the cases where you need to exchange it for another currency become minimal.

This has never been achieved yet.

It's true potential is not completely known. Perhaps it would foster such a degree of economic integration that many ills of our global existence as a species could be overcome.

I think it will be difficult to achieve because it faces extreme resistence by vested interests and certain aspects of human nature. It is extremely tempting for those who love power, to try to centralize and exclusively control any technology.

Hence much of recent political talk re: Bitcoin is too short-sighted, imo. It is practically guaranteed to engender political resistance, locally as well as on a global level, by tying itself to nationalistic or party slogans.

If Bitcoin is to succeed, it has to transcend our borders, tribalisms etc.

Fast forward to 2024, and BTC:

> [""Short version: I wouldn't withdraw amounts less than 1,000,000 sats into self custody. DCA on an exchange and only sweep to self custody when you've accumulated a decent amount."" -Jameson Lopp, co-founder & CTO of Casa](https://www.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/1gyxnpm/cold_storage_question/lyt9bc2/)

It's not bad advice, and Lopp isn't wrong on this point.

However, I really don't like this kind of inflation. Just like ordinary inflation makes your fiat money worth less, the inflation of minimum amounts and tx fees on a blockchain has the similar effect of making your money less usable and ultimately worth less. This can go to extremes if your UTXOs become a total loss. I hope BTC blockchain analysts are on the case.

__Alright, show of hands !__

_How many of you crypto newbies are withdrawing a minimum of almost a thousand dollars in BTC [as per Lopp and BTC close to $100K) at a pop from your CEX of choice?_

If not, remember that experienced voices in BTC are telling you essentially you're doing something which can cause you pain later. Danger, Will Robinson.

Another well known BTC voice:

> [Use a CEX, buy DCA and batch withdraw once a month. A lot of newbies advised to ""DCA and withdraw"" are going to get wrecked by fees when they try to sell/spend their thousands of tiny dust UTXO. It's going to be a bad scene. -Andreas Antonopoulos](https://np.reddit.com/r/BitcoinBeginners/comments/185v8s1/coinbase_to_ledger_question/kb40yfr/)

Definitely worth a read of Andreas' 2014 blog post on Mt Gox if like me you didn't get to experience it live.

A lot of people got their first hand experience with what can happen when bitcoins are left on a centralized exchange too long and you don't own the keys that control them.

https://web.archive.org/web/20140303115905/https://antonopoulos.com/2014/02/25/

""We must all draw hard lessons from this experience"".

Yes!

The beatings will continue until the intelligence quotient improves!

> ""There is a better way: bitcoin companies can maintain customer funds on the bitcoin blockchain with full transparency and accountability. We can offer client-side key-management solutions that put full control in the hands of the customers and remove them from the control of custodians, be they exchanges, markets or web-wallets. If a bitcoin company keeps custodial access to customer funds (holds their keys), then they can and must offer cryptographic-proof of solvency through the blockchain."" -Andreas Antonopoulos, from same blogpost linked above

To A.A.'s big credit he pushed for this to happen and the more responsible parts of the industry have responded and improved a bit. But it's still a bleak picture overall, with lots of people trusting CEXes and getting burned even in 2024.

However, what is far worse is that the self-custodial aspect is degrading on BTC, and will continue to do so as L1 fees rise.

I completely concur: ""_It's going to be a bad scene._"" And I expect ""_number go up_"" to apply _bigly_ to the minimum amount (in BTC sats) that BTC users will be advised to transact with, in order not to be stuck with economically unspendable amounts.

I know my proposition here runs counter to human greed, which is a very strong force and a good buddy of ignorance. Together, they may overwhelm reason and logic, and throw caution out the door.

But Bitcoin isn't that complicated, despite some prominent people trying to tell everyone basically that they can't understand it and that's alright.

No - you should have a basic grasp of how your money works.

We are coming from a financial world that is ruled by intransparency, complex schemes, incomprehensible jargon etc.

Bitcoin was an attempt to re-establish a sound monetary system on terms that could be well understood with a minuscule amount of effort. Certainly within the ability of the everyday interested adult. Not a problem for inquisitive children.
It contains some neat mathematical devices, but nothing that's not accessible to someone who's completed high school.

I think we have seen attempts to bring the same old jungle of financial mumbo jumbo to the cryptocurrency realm.

Things you're ""not meant to understand"", but put your money in them, and soon it will be gone, thank you very much. When this is on purpose, it actually offends me to a degree.

2024-11-24 09:53:19,BTC AND BCH WILL PIGGYBACK OFF EACH OTHER ,"BTC is marketed as a storage of value(digital gold). BCH is marketed as a peer-to-peer electronic cash system. The two biggest differences between both of these are the blocksize and transaction fees.
Fees
• BTC: The cost to transfer $100,000 could be anywhere from around $3 to $10 or more, based on current network conditions and your urgency for confirmation.
• BCH: For the same amount, you could expect to pay a fee that's just a few cents to a dollar or two, making it significantly cheaper for large transfers in terms of transaction cost.
Blocksize
• BTC: Has a block size limit of 1 MB, which was intended to keep blocks small and promote off-chain scaling solutions like the Lightning Network for better scalability. This has resulted in higher fees during network congestion.
• BCH: Increased its block size to 8 MB initially (now effectively up to 32 MB with the introduction of adaptive block size limits), aiming for on-chain scaling to allow more transactions per block, thereby reducing fees and increasing transaction capacity.
If BTC sticks to their blocksize and fees, their will be a market for people to use BCH for day to day purchases. BTC will be used by the ultra wealthy for big purchases, SBR(Strategic Bitcoin Reserve)and BCH will be used for day to day micro transactions. The only way I see this not working out is if BTC does a change to their blocksize reducing the transaction fees or if the Lightning Network is actually successful.  I welcome anybody to destroy my argument or a subject matter expert on the Lightning Network to chime in.",0,28,WordHour493,btc
2024-11-24 02:58:13,Billions want to come in BCH but they want you to dump it first . Please wrap your head around the following example:,"Estimating the hypothetical price increase from a $10.3 billion buy requires understanding market depth, which involves:
	1.	The current order book (how many BCH are available at each price point).
	2.	The elasticity of the market (how price changes as demand shifts).

Simplified Model for Price Impact

Let’s use the midpoint liquidity equation to approximate how price might react to a large buy:

￼
	•	Trade Size = $10.3 billion.
	•	Market Depth = The total dollar value available to absorb buys without significantly moving the price. If no precise data is available, we can assume market depth is 1%-5% of BCH’s current market cap (common in crypto markets). For BCH, with a market cap of ~$10.38 billion, market depth might range from $100 million to $500 million.

Scenario 1: Market Depth = $100 million

￼

This implies the price could increase by 103 times the starting price (524.56 × 103), bringing BCH to $54,028 per coin.

Scenario 2: Market Depth = $500 million

￼

This implies the price could increase by 20.6 times the starting price (524.56 × 20.6), bringing BCH to $10,801 per coin.

Reality Check

These estimates assume a linear response, but markets are more complex:
	•	Traders would react by selling into the rally, adding liquidity.
	•	Algorithmic traders and arbitrageurs would attempt to stabilize prices.

In reality, the price increase would likely fall somewhere between these extremes, but it would still be massive. A buy of this magnitude would fundamentally disrupt the BCH market.",0,22,Kingcoreythefirst,btc

2024-11-23 18:25:51,"There is an autonomous anyone-can-spend contract emitting small incentives to lock 0.1 BCH until block 1,000,000―every week for the next few years.","There is a perpetuity contract [here](https://unspent.app/contract?opReturn=6a047574786f0150010202f30323aa206ff0c730cf850dcdb17428a777c5b4cfa0059f1220ac1910f5fb93aec9bd9fb68702dc05012823aa204a2610207cba588268ecec64f5a81ca888a9378de7fd78dfba6745a1cea973f387&network=mainnet),  which is currently funded with a single UTXO holding 6.8M sats in value. Anyone can spend from the contract each week and claim a little 1500 sat allowance, as long as they send at least 1/40th of current utxo balance to [this other address](https://explorer.electroncash.de/address/bitcoincash:rdhlp3ese7zsmnd3ws52wa79kn86qpvlzgs2cxgs7hae8tkfhk0mvwlnsxqy5).

The beneficiary of the perpetuity is a different contract. It's a ""coupon"" contract to incentivize locking 0.1 BCH [until block 1,000,000 in 2027](https://futurebitcoin.cash/v?block=1000000).

So every week, this autonomous contract on BCH will pay anyone to write a coupon, and the coupon can then be used by anyone locking BCH.

The outpoint: 

    54fafc9065b2774b86df2c58d2df7117ab2c61871db3885ec08ccb9df1b139a8:0

... was the first coupon written [here](https://explorer.electroncash.de/tx/54fafc9065b2774b86df2c58d2df7117ab2c61871db3885ec08ccb9df1b139a8)

This is actually very boring, because coupons are just being emitted at regular intervals at essentially predetermined amounts. 

It would be more interesting to fund a contract that could emit coupons based on input from an oracle. 

Perhaps, some weeks an anyone-can-spend contract might write a bigger coupon, or no coupon at all. 

If the logic of the contract is known, and the balance of the contract is known, it gives a very powerful signal to the market of what coupons will be available to incentivize futures from week to week. 

EDIT:

There's 125 weeks between now and block 1,000,000. So if all the coupons being emitted by this contract were used, it would result in 12.5 BCH becoming locked, for the cost of 6.8M sats.",18,2,2q_x,btc
2024-11-23 18:20:37,"The vision, set forth by the enigmatic Satoshi Nakamoto.","Bitcoin P2P Electronic Cash serves as a powerful testament to the enduring legacy and core principles of decentralization, remaining faithful to the original vision outlined in the 2008 Bitcoin whitepaper. This vision, set forth by the enigmatic Satoshi Nakamoto, emphasized creating a peer-to-peer digital cash system that ensures financial freedom and independence from centralized control.

BitcoinCash builds on this foundation by addressing some of Bitcoin's scalability challenges, enabling faster and cheaper transactions. These advancements make it more practical for everyday use, such as microtransactions and global remittances, while preserving the decentralized ethos that underpins the cryptocurrency movement.

The growing adoption and real-world impact of Bitcoin Cash highlight its significance as a modern evolution of Bitcoin's original purpose. By making decentralized digital currency more accessible and efficient, Bitcoin Cash honors the contributions of the pioneers who have shaped and nurtured this revolutionary technology over the years.

As we explore and adopt innovations like Bitcoin Cash, it is essential to recognize the profound role they play in advancing financial sovereignty and technological progress, staying true to the principles laid out in the groundbreaking whitepaper that started it all.

One outstanding educational book that captures the current landscape of the crypto world is Hijacking Bitcoin. It provides readers with valuable insights and in-depth information about the latest developments in peer-to-peer electronic cash systems, making it an essential read for anyone interested in decentralized cryptocurrency today.

With BTC nearing $100k, I’ve been wondering: could Bitcoin Cash have a bigger role to play in the future than people expect? It has the kind of name recognition that’s hard to ignore, especially when Bitcoin is on everyone’s radar. If people start looking into ‘Bitcoin cash’ —whether by curiosity or confusion—what might they find?

There’s something interesting about how BCH compares to BTC. It’s not just the price difference; it feels like BCH is positioned differently. Maybe it’s a more practical option, or maybe it aligns more closely with what Bitcoin was meant to be in the first place. And then there’s the matter of scarcity…

I’m not saying it’s a sure thing, but it makes me wonder if BCH has something unique going for it. As BTC continues to grab headlines, will BCH start attracting more attention too?

A visionary entrepreneur has launched **HandPay**, a bold project aimed at replacing outdated devices like pendrives with a **cold wallet implanted in the hand**. The idea is simple yet groundbreaking: a chip beneath the skin, capable of securely storing cryptocurrencies offline.

https://preview.redd.it/uet9n988ej2e1.png?width=1610&format=png&auto=webp&s=9fbee45576c197968b387261cee961200870df80

Unlike traditional digital wallets, HandPay doesn’t rely on external servers. All encryption and digital assets are stored directly on the chip, functioning as a personal safe. Additionally, the device will feature a validation app for quick and secure transactions, eliminating intermediaries. ""Pendrives are outdated. The future is having your coins literally in your hands,"" says the project’s creator.

The concept has already attracted the attention of Brazilian and international entrepreneurs. According to close sources, former president Jair Bolsonaro is reportedly organizing a meeting with Donald Trump and Elon Musk to discuss support for HandPay's development. Musk’s involvement, in particular, could bring significant technological advancements to the project, aligning it with Neuralink's expertise and the universe of digital transactions.

Still in its early stages, HandPay has the potential to completely redefine how we make payments and store value. It's not just a technological innovation; it's a movement that promises to reshape the relationship between humans and money. HandPay isn’t just a chip—it’s a bold vision of a future where technology merges with the human body to deliver financial autonomy and security.

2024-11-22 22:22:48,I constantly have issues with the lightning network that are not my fault,"I don't like lightning. I still test it once in a while to see how it's doing. Recently I had a ~$50 lightning payment fail between cash app and one of the services aggregated by trocador. It couldn't find a path between the two services. Then just today, I was unable to send any amount from river to minibits for the same reason. Wallets that rely on the boltz integration such as aqua and more popular wallets like strike seem to be better connected within the lightning network.

This is not what I signed up for years ago. I was led to believe that cryptocurrency payments are unstoppable. The technology enabled me to send and receive any amount to anyone else on the network. I did not have to worry about payment routing or anything. Everyone was connected to everyone else. This will not be the case in a future with scarce blockspace dominated by lightning service providers. I can either compete for artificially scarce blockspace, or hope that my custodian of choice has good connectivity with the person I want to pay. Banks will make the rules. You can see the benefits of this technology are degrading over time. This is why payment channels are not the answer to the scaling problem.

I firmly believe that there are alternatives to BTC that are set up better. I just like to know what I'm talking about before I make negative remarks about what BTC is doing, so I subject myself to these tortures. I just want something that actually works.

2024-11-22 11:15:13,An examination of claims of BTC adoption based on coin distribution,"This post is not meant only as a criticism of BTC, but since there've been a number of new commenters I encountered here recently, coming with claims of mass BTC adoption (__even as a store of value!__) during the latest bull run, I decided to look at these claims in the bigger picture. Much of the same applies to other cryptocurrencies right now - I am not exempting my favorite, Bitcoin Cash, in any way!

Similarly, it is likely to apply to non-Bitcoin-like crypto as well - until you see your local green grocer and most other shops around you accepting payment in crypto. I don't have the distribution numbers for all others though, neither do I know. Please respond with data in comments if you think your favorite crypto is in a much better position.

_[Initially I made a comment reply which this post is based on, but it got caught in the auto-moderator, which is also why I decided to make a separate post.]_

Here goes.

---

The following is based on the data from the bitinfocharts BTC address distribution linked in the comments. The calculations below are from ~ 2 days ago, I doubt much has changed, and the numbers will be rounded a bit - it doesn't affect my general conclusion.

1. The total number of BTC addresses listed there holding funds when I took a look are something like 55M (rounding up, the precise number at the time was 54,563,975).

2. Only ~23.4M (23,387,208) had more than $100 in bitcoins.

3. For more-than-$1000 and more-than-$10K, the number of addresses are 11.7M (11,715,381) and 4.2M (4,172,342) respectively.

4. These don't correspond 1-1 to users. More than one address can, and often does, belong to a single user. Meaning the number of real users actually holding coins are less than the number of addresses.

5. So the number of holder with substantial funds in BTC can assuredly be reckoned in the low millions. Probably _significantly_ less than 5 million users. (ask yourself how many BTC UTXOs _you hold_, whether you're typical, and if so, divide by some similar number to approximate the real users which is going to be even lower).

6. The original poster I commented said that we should assume only half the world's population to be in a position to use Bitcoin at all - some are too young, some too old, some not in areas with necessary infrastructure. So I agreed we should be generous and not consider the total world population (~ 8B) , but we can halve it (~ 4B) to assess the state of BTC adoption.

7. If we take the 5 million users from point (5), then that gives us at best 5M / 4000M = 0.00125 = fraction of world's population that might hold substantial funds in BTC. i.e. __Just over 0.1 percent. That is an _upper bound_ on how much of ""the masses"" can possibly have adopted BTC (*) as a store of value as of this time.__ As we shall see, the amount of wealth stored by more users holding small amounts is very small, one might say insignificant in the global scheme of things.

8. Looking at the BTC distribution from bitinfocharts , around 4.1M addresses > $10K addresses accounted for 98.73% of all BTC held, as per the table, roughly (I took the 0.1 BTC line as approximately equiv. to $10K right now).

9. Less than 10% of all addresses hold almost 99% of all BTC.

10. Conclusion: No more (+) than 0.125% of _half of_ the world's population are holding > 98% of the available BTC. 

_(*) I am not including those who think they hold BTC just because they hold ""paper bitcoins"" (IOUs) on some exchange without having ever taken the coins into their own custody_

_(+) because of the aforementioned possibility that multiple addresses are same holder, i.e. number of real holders is less than addresses_

I think such an examination from the basic undeniable facts (number of loaded addresses and coin distribution) is well suited to challenging claims that BTC has seen ""wide adoption"" or ""mass adoption"". Even as a hypothetical store of value!

---

bitinfocharts link to the rich list data in comments, to reduce risk of post getting auto-modded away.

I will present more questions that this has raised for me in comments too.

---

Limitations of this examination: 

- I have not counted those who hold their bitcoins on some exchange (where they might be fractionally reserved, i.e. effectively ""paper bitcoins"" or IOUs""), as really owning coins. ""Not your keys, not your coins"". Try to withdraw into your own custody to find out if you have really adoption bitcoins or if your exchange thinks you haven't.

- It is conceivable that some user hold their funds in cold storage with centralized custodians in order to protect them. There are such companies. I don't know how big their userbase is - would appreciate feedback. It is a fact that those bitcoins are at higher risk of finding new owners (through embezzlement, hacking of companies, government confiscation etc) than bitcoins held distributed across millions of self-custodial users.",7,21,LovelyDayHere,btc

2024-11-22 07:33:31,"The Critical Importance of Bitcoin Education: Safeguarding Individuals and Society In a world rapidly transitioning toward digital finance, the importance of Bitcoin and blockchain education cannot be overstated. ","Despite its growing adoption and integration into mainstream financial systems by countries like El Salvador, the Central African Republic, and Japan, a significant portion of the population—including highly educated professionals—lacks a clear understanding of Bitcoin and its underlying blockchain technology. This knowledge gap can have serious consequences, as even prominent individuals, such as IPS officers, may fall victim to scams, resulting in reputational damage, legal troubles, or worse.

The Risks of Ignorance
Cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin, Bitcoin Cash, Litecoin, and Dogecoin operate on decentralized proof-of-work (PoW) blockchain technology, offering transparency, security, and efficiency. However, many of the cryptocurrencies in existence today are essentially scams. They lack a decentralized PoW blockchain network and instead rely on centrally controlled chains that are vulnerable to manipulation—much like fiat currencies.

When individuals, regardless of their professional stature, fail to grasp the basics of crypto, they become vulnerable to fraud, legal troubles, and other risks.

The Consequences of Ignorance
Personal Harm: Scams can result in financial losses, eroded trust, and emotional stress.
Reputational Damage: Public figures and professionals who fall victim to scams risk losing credibility and may face legal action.



Conclusion

The Government Must Step In to Foster Bitcoin/Crypto Education

Community Awareness Campaigns:
Governments, educational institutions, and private organizations must collaborate to spread awareness about cryptocurrencies, focusing on both opportunities and risks.

Workshops and Training:
Regular workshops for law enforcement, professionals, and the public can provide hands-on knowledge about Bitcoin transactions, blockchain technology, and security measures.

Accessible Resources:
Simplified guides, videos, and online courses can make crypto education more accessible to everyone, regardless of their technical background.


Bitcoin education is not just about technological understanding—it is a safeguard against scams, a foundation for innovation, and a step toward financial empowerment. In a world where misinformation can cause significant harm, equipping individuals with accurate knowledge about Bitcoin and blockchain is more important than ever.

The focus of this post and links is not to explain or justify any specific incident but to emphasize the importance of educating and empowering the public about cryptocurrencies.

2024-11-21 06:21:44,"The Misconception About Bitcoin and Anonymity in Illegal Transactions The comment, ""Use Bitcoin; it cannot be traced back to us,"" reflects a common misunderstanding about Bitcoin and blockchain technology. ","Many believe Bitcoin is a tool for anonymous transactions, ideal for illegal activities, but the reality is far from it.
Bitcoin operates on a transparent, public ledger known as the blockchain. Every transaction ever made is permanently recorded and visible to anyone with internet access. While Bitcoin addresses are pseudonymous (not directly tied to your real-world identity), they are not truly anonymous. With enough investigative effort, blockchain analytics firms and law enforcement agencies can trace these transactions back to individuals.
Several high-profile criminal cases have proven this. From dark web busts to ransomware payments, authorities have successfully tracked Bitcoin transactions, linked them to specific wallets, and identified the people behind them. In fact, trying to use Bitcoin for illegal activities is akin to leaving a digital trail of breadcrumbs for investigators.
For those who think Bitcoin offers a safe haven for crime, the truth is simple: it doesn’t. Instead, it provides a transparent and immutable record of every action—a record that can and will be used to hold wrongdoers accountable. If anything, relying on Bitcoin for illegal activity is not just risky but outright foolish.",9,1,InstaCrypto_INC,btc

For newbies, back in 2022, Stronghold was accused of hiding issues with contracted suppliers, missed deadlines, and difficulties in obtaining new mining equipment. In March 2022, their financial reports revealed losses higher than they had claimed during their IPO a few months earlier. 



As a result, $SDIG fell, and investors filed a lawsuit alleging they were misled about Stronghold’s mining capacity, operational costs, and the feasibility of expanding its mining fleet during its IPO.



The good news is that the company finally agreed to pay investors $4.75M + 25 BTC over this whole situation. So, if you were an investor back then, you can check the details and [file for payment here](https://11thestate.com/cases/strongholddigital-investor-settlement).

General Usage: The data below provides you with everything you will need to use your addresses anywhere you deem fit. The addresses in your Block.io account are multi-signature addresses of the type P2SH, P2WSH-over-P2SH, or P2WSH. Each address requires two private keys. The first key is BIP32-derived, and the second key is fixed.

The information below may be incomplete for developers that have used Distributed Trust addresses, for which you specified your own public keys, and already have the redeem scripts needed.



We recommend using self-hosted Bitcoin Core, Litecoin Core, and Dogecoin Core wallet software for using these keys to transact with your addresses, but you can determine and use any other tools that might fit your needs. A reference sweep script is provided at https://github.com/BlockIo/blockio-basic-multisig-sweep, but you will need to implement your own blockchain backend for it to work.

My comment, which Reddit removed, only gave my personal opinion - cynical as it may have been about the prediction being made by a fund which claims to hold bitcoins on its clients behalf - and linked to two official pages on their website about the HODL ETF.

The following statement was quoted in abbreviation, I will now quote it here in full, only linking to an archived copy of their page.

If this quote is what made Reddit censor my comment, then I expect this post to also be censored shortly.

But you should know about it, it is all public information that VanEck puts out themselves.

Quote:

> __An investment in the VanEck Bitcoin ETF (“HODL,” or the “Trust”) is subject to significant risk and may not be suitable for all investors. HODL is not an investment company registered under the Investment Company Act of 1940 (the “1940 Act”) and therefore is not subject to the same protections as mutual funds or ETFs registered under the 1940 Act.__

Not your keys, not your coins.

I am wondering now, when VanEck states (also on their page):

> Shares are physically backed by bitcoin and held in cold storage* at a qualified custodian

Whether they remain responsible for the bitcoin backing of their trust in any significant way at all, or whether the above disclaimer largely does away with that.

But even more, I'd like to know why Reddit saw it fit to censor my opinion.

If your aim is to arrive at a sound monetary system, then this is mildly counterproductive, especially if every transaction conducted in fiat is a transaction not conducted in bitcoins.

2024-11-17 08:19:57,What if people stopped mining BTC?,"I asked ChatGPT what if people stopped mining BTC what would happen 🤔

ChatGPT answer this:
---

If people stop mining Bitcoin, it would have several serious consequences for the network. Here are the major effects:

1. Reduced Network Security

Proof-of-Work and Security: The Bitcoin network relies on Proof-of-Work (PoW) to ensure that all transactions are valid and to protect the network from attacks. Miners use their computational power to solve cryptographic problems and create new blocks, which makes it extremely difficult to manipulate the blockchain.

Attacks: If no one is mining, the network would become highly vulnerable to various types of attacks. The most well-known attack is a 51%-attack, where someone controls more than 50% of the network’s computational power and can alter historical transactions or block new ones. If there are no miners working to solve PoW puzzles, there would be no computational power to secure the network.


2. No New Bitcoin Created

Creation of New Bitcoin: Mining is the only process that creates new Bitcoin. If no one mines, no new Bitcoin will be created. This would halt the continuous influx of new coins into the market.

No Reward: When the Bitcoin network reaches its maximum limit of 21 million Bitcoin, miners will have to rely on transaction fees as their income. If no one mines, there would be no rewards, and transaction fees wouldn't be processed.


3. Transactions Can't Be Processed

Blockchain: Mining is also the process that processes and verifies transactions. Without miners, transactions couldn’t be included in new blocks, and the Bitcoin network wouldn't be able to process any new transactions.

Transaction Delays: If no one mines, the Bitcoin network would effectively become ""stuck"" because transactions couldn’t be confirmed or included in blocks.


4. Difficulty Adjustment and Economic Effects

Difficulty Adjustment: If the number of miners drops significantly, the Bitcoin network’s difficulty would automatically adjust downward to make it easier to mine blocks. But if mining completely ceases, no one would be able to create new blocks, and it would be impossible to adjust the difficulty to a level where new blocks could be created.

Market Reaction: The market would likely react negatively to a sudden cessation of mining, as it would mean Bitcoin loses its decentralized nature, and trust in the network would decrease. This could lead to a sharp drop in Bitcoin prices and potentially other cryptocurrencies taking over.

Mining Becomes Unprofitable: Given that the difficulty of mining has increased over the years, it is now much more expensive and resource-intensive to mine Bitcoin. As the network's difficulty rises, miners need more powerful and specialized hardware, such as ASICs, to remain competitive. If mining rewards (block rewards and transaction fees) aren't sufficient to cover the increased costs, mining becomes unprofitable. This could cause miners to exit the network, further destabilizing the ecosystem.


5. Long-Term Outlook: A Shift to a New Cryptocurrency?

Inevitable Decline: Eventually, Bitcoin may face a point where it becomes unsustainable due to the increasing difficulty of mining and the rising costs involved. While the network may continue to operate for some time, the challenges Bitcoin faces—such as high energy consumption, lack of scalability, and an increasingly centralized mining landscape—will become harder to ignore. As the mining process becomes more costly and less profitable, Bitcoin’s appeal could decline.

A New Cryptocurrency: In the near future, people may begin to realize these limitations and may look for a cryptocurrency with better prospects for scalability, energy efficiency, and decentralization. New cryptocurrencies or blockchain projects could emerge with improved consensus mechanisms, better economic models, and stronger networks that could replace Bitcoin as the leading cryptocurrency. This shift may not happen overnight, but over time, Bitcoin could find itself overshadowed by more advanced alternatives that offer better long-term viability.


6. Conclusion

Bitcoin is built on the premise that decentralization and mining drive the network forward. Mining allows for the creation of new Bitcoin, transaction verification, and ensures that no one can manipulate the network. Without mining, Bitcoin would quickly lose its core functions and could become unusable as a secure, decentralized currency.

While it is unlikely that all miners would stop simultaneously, a massive reduction in mining would make Bitcoin much more vulnerable and potentially non-functional. Additionally, with the difficulty level so high and mining becoming increasingly expensive, many miners could find it unprofitable to continue, further compromising the network's security and stability. Bitcoin may eventually face a situation where it becomes increasingly obsolete, and the rise of a new cryptocurrency with better future prospects and a more sustainable network could be just a matter of time.

The U.S. government is attempting to imprison Roger Ver for 109 years for the crime of following his lawyers’ advice.

For 181 days (and counting), he's been forced to remain in Spain because of the U.S. Justice Department.

Ironically, this attack on Roger happened not long after he released his book, titled ""*Hijacking Bitcoin*"". It's a fantastic book that I highly recommend. It details, with receipts, how the government meddled in Bitcoin's development, among other concerning issues. I personally think this is why they attacked him.

2024-11-16 10:39:11,Saylor's Plan to Keep Buying Bitcoin.,"Hey folks, I'm a bit confused and hoping someone can explain this to me. I watched a MicroStrategy conference video on YouTube where Michael Saylor claims Bitcoin is going to reach $13M by 2045, which sounds great. He also mentioned that his company plans to continuously buy Bitcoin and never sell it.

My question is: how can this plan work indefinitely? Assuming Saylor is being truthful and his company never sells any Bitcoin, what happens when his company owns most or all of the Bitcoin? Wouldn't Bitcoin lose its value to everyone else because Saylor's company would be the only one holding it? At that point, wouldn't people simply switch to a different asset that is more decentralized to store their wealth?

Am I missing something here? This seems like a mega ponzi plan to me and i can see a rug getting pulled at some point. ",8,49,MarchHareHatter,btc

2024-11-15 11:32:21,Wrapped BTC Staking Unveiled: How ExSat’s Innovative Bridge is Transforming Bitcoin’s Ecosystem,"ExSat, short for ""Extend Satoshi,"" is a project focused on enhancing the capabilities of the Bitcoin ecosystem. It went live about 2 weeks ago and has already launched its highly anticipated Bitcoin staking feature. I say ""highly anticipated"" because it has attracted over $600 million in TVL and more than 40 validators since going live on the mainnet. 

Let’s break it down. As a PoW consensus network, Bitcoin traditionally had no yield potential through staking. However, ExSat’s mainnet launch has changed that by introducing a unique staking mechanism. It involves the creation of the ExSat bridge. With this bridge now active, users can stake BTC and receive XBTC, a wrapped token pegged 1:1 with native BTC. This allows users to retain control of their original Bitcoin while earning yield. Additionally, stakers also earn XSAT tokens. 

The bridge is highly reliable, having undergone extensive auditing by Blocksec. It was developed in partnership with notable firms like ChainUp and Cactus, ensuring a seamless experience for users. This is a significant advancement for the Bitcoin ecosystem, and we are excited to see Bitcoin’s TVL rise with these innovations.",22,6,amossatan,btc

For example, they mention how in 2012, Ver gave his law firm a list of assets and some exit tax calculation.   
How is that not protected? And later, there’s a conversation where he’s talking strategy with his lawyer about how to value his Bitcoin.

**Was it through his lawyers?**

**Did they somehow just seize it?**

**How did they get this info?**

**Again, how are these private conversations being used in the indictment?**

**How did they get these emails?** Were they turned over by Ver or one of his attorneys, or were they secured by other methods?

 Shouldn’t Ver have been able to fight this?

Does anyone know how this works? Is the government overreaching here or what’s the deal? And where’s Ver’s case at right now?

2024-11-12 09:57:23,Why btc is long term asset ,"Hi everyone. I follow cryptos since 2016, when i was 17. 
Didnt invest until 2k24 , just traded but this is not the good thing cuz il fully degen. So i started a daily dca to become a safer investor. 

This is a good Time to make a post about crypto with the currently trend. 

1: I believe that a New subprime will come in few years maximum(already begining) , it will strenghten digital currencies. 

2 : More and more institutions buy Btc, poor countries will make Fomo richest nations. Even with the Brics currently scaling like never before afraid developed countries (no btc needed ahah) 
So, they have to buy Btc, to avoid giving emerging countries a head start, even if they don't believe in it. Because if BTC reaches peaks like 500k or 1M, they will be ridiculed to the fullest.

3: The policy of developed countries could impact BTC, such as through tax rates, prohibitions, etc. But, in my opinion, emergent countries will fill the dips.

4: Lot of rate variations yeah, more than every other assets. But in time of crises, for exemple in covid (rare ok, but other crises will occur). DJ 30 Lost 37% , Cac 40 ( il french) Lost 40% and oil Brent Lost fking 70% (wtf). 
Why should u more believe in reel economy than in digital economy 

5: I know that 80% of retail investors lose money in crypto because it is not yet well established, and trades rarely exceed one year. The day médias and Big president will believe in cryptos, people will have less apprehensions and will let it run even if it goes low. 

6: Higher inflation and higher Loan rates mean less investment in real estate and more investment in cryptos because letting money on bank account is the worst thing u can Do. 

7: lost wallets are not that rare , it increase the value as inflation do, there is a double inflation on btc

8: bankrupties like Terra Luna doesn't affect cryptos in the long term, it's not crypto faut but the trading platform fault. 

9: People are increasingly informed in the age of the information era and are becoming more and more aware that traditional banks are taking advantage of them. Gamestop was the first big move like that, one of a long list incoming. Robbinhood cut the buy button, this is fking crazy, it cannot happens again. Also, the volumes and the number of transactions by retail investors reach record highs every year (excluding crises).



10: Institutions have far less control over crypto because they didn't believe in it early enough. They might gain control later, but by then BTC will already be at 500k.

11: Wars like 🇮🇱🇵🇸 🇷🇺🇺🇦 only strengthens confidence in crypto because the economy is unstable and embargoes happen frequently. Btc is probably the only worldwide currency u can buy from everywhere when u want.

12: In the long term, BTC has all the conditions to break through ceilings and become an investment revolution, similar to how AI is transforming and will transform the digital world.

13: Crypto is not yet well established. Most of people Say that im a degen to put money in cryptos, even the young people.
I have an acquaintance who was trader in insurrances, he had to manage 1 billion for few years, this man looks at me like "" no please dont put in cryptos, u will lose everything. I Can speak about cryptos with like 1/20 of people i meet. People prefer spending money in club than investing for the futur (i'm one of them, thats why i did a Loan🙃) 

14: The further we move forward in time, the younger generations grow up with technology. As these young people gain investment power over the years, they have far more confidence in crypto than our elders.

15 : The advent of digital currencies issued by various countries and central banks shows an increased involvement from the global monetary system to become an integral part of this cryptographic revolution.


To sum-up Bitcoin isn’t just an investment you make on a one-year FOMO; it’s a lifetime commitment. Yes, you can take profits and buy the dips like in any market, but holding crypto for 15-20 years has the potential to grow your wealth, much like real estate or the stock market.

Thanks you for reading, i'm not professional but there is not in cryptos. Just my opinion. Any feedback is welcome—feel free to add points you find relevant, as well as risks that contradict my view since I haven’t covered those. Apologies for my non-native English 🙂

The idea is not to have a single 'source of truth' of course, but services that the user could choose.

Sort of like phone call spam filtering, your wallet could tell you that it thinks an incoming transaction from an unknown address _might_ be spam/malicious, and you could take action manually or in some automated way.

A new crypto scam is on the rise, called address poisoning or address spoofing. Perpetrators use the transparency of public blockchains to identify pairs of addresses that transact with each other often and “poison” one of the addresses’ transaction history by sending to it a small amount of crypto from an address that is similar but not identical to their usual counterpart. The scammers hope that the next time the victim is about to send funds to the familiar address, they will unwittingly copy the “poisoned” string of characters and misplace the funds for the criminals' benefit.

One might think, who would fall for such a basic trick? In fact, more people than you think, especially when criminals deploy this technique at scale. Just a few days ago, a trader lost some $68 million worth of crypto in a single transaction to an address-poisoning scammer.

Poison for the Unwary
Crypto wallet addresses can consist of as much as 42 alphanumeric characters. We have all been there – when transferring some crypto to a friend or withdrawing funds from an exchange to our own self-custodial wallet, we don’t always scrutinize each character of the destination address. Dealing with a hodgepodge of seemingly random digits and letters that is an average address, the temptation is strong to rely on cognitive shortcuts. 

For example, it is common for crypto users to only glance at the first and last several characters of the address copied from one’s smartphone notes or transaction history, especially if this is a wallet with which one has previously interacted.

Address poisoning, also known as address spoofing, is a deceptive tactic where scammers send small amounts of cryptocurrency, NFTs, or worthless tokens from a wallet that closely mimics the recipient's or a frequently used partner's address, thus making its way to transaction history. If the victim is in the habit of copying and reusing addresses from recent transactions when sending crypto, they can end up sending their funds to the scammer’s wallet. 

Criminals scan public blockchains to identify potential victims, often looking for pairs of addresses that interact frequently. Such scams can occur on any blockchain, but Ethereum and networks like Polygon, Avalanche, and BNB Smart Chain are particularly vulnerable – the latter three due to relatively low transaction fees, which enable bad actors to deploy their schemes cheaply and at scale.

Scammers rely on vanity address generators – services that allow users to customize parts of addresses to make them appear recognizable and “less random.” For example, an authentic Ethereum address like 0x19x30f…62657 could be spoofed using a similar-looking 0x19x30t…72657, which can be totally different in the middle while maintaining the first and last few characters.",12,24,upunup,btc

There will be people to pop up to say they don't get it, or that it's not for them, or that it's too small to mean anything. Which is fine. 

But whether or not people in Bitcoin Cash choose to use it make money or change the future, it may have an effect their holdings whether they like it or not. 

If a single party chooses unilaterally incentivize less liquidity in the near or long-term market, they do not need permission from anyone to do that. It just costs money.

Historically, with on-chain DeFi technologies emerge, the migration of capital to on-chain instruments can cause significant liquidity issues for under-capitalized exchanges. 

If users have coins held in an omnibus account in a jurisdiction that is a hot-bed of financial crime, corruption, and capricious asset forfeiture, it may be a good time to consider whether now might be a good time to stop fucking around before [everyone finds out what happens to suckers.](https://archive.org/details/DontBeaS1947)

It would be a very different proposition if such a market executed directly on the basis of a sound, non-inflationary, well-distributed electronic currency (and offered its users to temporarily swap into that for the purposes of using it).

While unsound money is flush and can be printed right out of the vacuum without repercussions on the cartels involved, it can severely distort money-based prediction markets.

I think for such markets to be useful, the majority of the funds put in should come from people who are not otherwise in control of the outcomes (except by making the market ""speak"", or ""voting with their wallets"").

For example, say a coupon writer sends 1M sats to the a coupon contract to lock 1 BCH till next week. 

In that case, anyone may then bring 99M sats, and the 1M coupon and lock the 100M sats in the vault and obtain 100M sat FBCH-0872000 in the process. 

There would then be 1 FBCH-0872000 released from the vault and 1 BCH more in the vault. 

The coupon taker knows they got paid, and they know their FBCH is fully backed. There is no trust or promise. 

# Ah ha, but these yield rates are too high (or too low)

A coupon is an unspent transaction output (UTXO) on a coupon contract. It's an irrevocable bid for coins to be locked as futures. 

There are no ""take backs"", there is no way for the coupon writer to adjust or withdraw their coupon (without locking BCH for FBCH).

So if someone puts up 20k sats to lock 1 BCH for a week, a 1% coupon may not interest anyone to give up their BCH for a week. 

However, when the time remaining to maturation is 500 blocks (half a week) then the effective rate of yield for the period remaining has doubled, it's now 2%.

When there's 18 hours left the effective rate is 10% apy. And when there's 10 blocks left the effective rate is 100% apy.

So the effective rates of every coupon increases with every block, and they increase asymptotically toward infinity as the time remaining goes toward zero.

Normally, if a app is showing any kind of yield on BCH, it's an under-capitalized ponzi. But in the case of a fully backed prebate... when there's 1 block remaining to maturity, a 20k sat coupon on one coin is a 1,000% apy. And it's real. And anyone can inspect it. 

That crazy yield is only for about 10 minutes on average, but it's real. 

# Lets divide a recursive monetary market by zero!

What happens if the coupon takers lose the game of claiming all the coupons? 

What happens when the poor punters trying to take the juiciest coupons run out of bitcoin and have to watch passively as the effective yield gets yeeted toward infinity?

What happens beyond T-0 to coupons when there is no time remaining, and the redemption vault is open?

Well, it's a free money feast.

The coupons are unencumbered by the constrains of a blocktime, meaning anyone can go gobbling them all up by claiming them in a transaction that places BCH in the FBCH vault, and then immediately redeeming that FBCH to go back and claim more coupons. 

It's kind of a brawl on the blockchain as users race each other to claim all the coupons.

Coupon cleanup will eventually be a matter of hashpower, but for now it's fun poor man's game. 

The lock amounts can be big, too. There was a 3M sat coupon to place 100 BCH claimed on Tuesday night, [in block 871003](https://explorer.electroncash.de/address/bitcoincash:rdr703gaj2lyzfj904858k66fzjh7vwv3t7qsvqv5jl3n49hm5gak8dt9qeyk). The coupon market failed, and the 3M sats was ""free"" to the user that sopped it up with 100 BCH.

# Why would anyone write a coupon? It doesn't make sense.

Coupons are VERY REAL. There are going to be a lot of them. 

The expected value to the coupon taker should ALWAYS be positive.  EVERY SINGLE coupon *taker* should make money on their trade, in a way that is pretty isolated from fiat influence and harmful manipulation. (a long as the coupon is over ~900 sats to cover fees)

There are no oracles or liquidations. 

Coupon takers get paid for their behavior, but coupon writers get to influence that behavior. 

If someone doesn't understand why coupons are written, they can still take free money—they want to be a coupon *taker*. 

# What do coupon writers want? 

A coupon *writer* may be in individual, or a decentralized organization or an oracle driven anyone-can-spend contract. 

The writers get to augment Bitcoin Cash's hard-coded reward schedule with other aims, as long as that aim involves locking more Bitcoin Cash. 

In general, a writer would be looking to write the cheapest coupon that another party will accept to place some amount of coins. If the writer is too low, the passage of time makes the coupon yield rate higher and there's a market or it gets claimed in cleanup. 

# Coupon takers want money.

Coupon *takers* want the juiciest coupons for the shortest duration.

Now. Waiting for a few blocks before a vault opens may theoretically by 10,000% interest for ten minutes, but obviously making money for 2 blocks a week will average out to a rate that's about five hundred times less than the rate shown near maturity. So in time it might make sense to just take a nice coupon at the start of a week and wait for 1000 blocks to do that again.

Coupon takers are also competing with each other. Every block they wait increases the chance someone else will take the coupon. The easy way to win the game is to just be first. 

Once a coupon taker has exhausted their liquidity they have to wait for a vault to open to redeem. So when weekly vaults open, there's a bit of a *witching* or race to redeem futures for coins to go claim the hottest coupons for the following week. 

There is what could is called double, triple and quad witching dates, which there may be a lot of turnover if a vault has been open for a very long time accumulating BCH. 

# Finally, a Future is NOT a Swap

There is a competing product in the Bitcoin Cash ecosystem called BCH Bull. Like FBCH, users can get a prebate for entering into what's called a ""contract for difference swap"" that gets settled later in BCH, but that's a bit more speculative and considerably higher risk than what is possible with FBCH. 

When users take a prebate for hedging on BCH Bull, they cannot be liquidated but they don't know how much of their funds they'll get back. They're agreeing to get a non-BCH pegged amount back, and have the difference reflected in BCH returned. 

If the price of BCH is $500, and a user enters into a month long swap with 1 BCH for a 12% prebate, if the price of BCH doubles, they'd end up only getting 0.51 BCH back. Obviously BCH can always go down too. 

In contrast, if a user places 1 BCH for 1 FBCH-0875000, they know they're going to get their prebate and full 1 BCH back, regardless of what happened in the tether markets. There's a very different exposure to broader market risks that come with swaps that aren't there in the case of a simple fully collateralized future. 

The good folks at General Protocols aren't trying to conflate swaps with futures, but there may be malicious actors that try to conflate, misrepresent or downplay the risks associated with swaps verses a future. I'd bet good money there are a number of people hanging around BCH spaces that will feel compelled to promote swaps every single time BCH futures get mentioned.",6,5,2q_x,btc

The fact that bitcoin is designed to increase in price forever means that it won't be any good as a currency. The whole reason most central banks try to aim for a 2% inflation rate is that if a fiat currency increases in value overtime, people will be incentivized to hoard it instead of spending it. This is not a good thing. Money is meant to be spent and circulate in the economy. If the value of your currency keeps going up, then the prices of goods and services will continuously go down, and people will be incentivized to hold off on making purchases until prices are even lower. This lowers demand for goods and services until businesses are forced to downsize. This produces high unemployment which reduces spending even more because unemployed people can't spend a lot of money.

Edit: I should've worded this a little more clearly. Obviously bitcoin isn't literally designed to increase in value forever, but it is designed to increase in value and then to never undergo inflation. A 0% inflation rate is still incompatible with economic growth.",0,67,lurker_Ad_9382,btc

I have longstanding mental health issues and have been locked up before as a result of them. As long as Ross is not a threat or danger to society and cooperates with the laws from now on, I can't imagine what it must have been like to be in his shoes. 

I'm not defending him, and I respect people who want him locked up. But he's just a normal guy like you or me who had a fascination with crypto but became egomaniacal and lost touch with his inner self. More importantly, once he's free, ***his family*** can stop their suffering. I have an autistic daughter and I would never want to know she became a felon and now has to serve a double life sentence. 

That kind of thing would ruin a parent's life, knowing that their son or daughter is locked up forever and there's nothing you can do about it. 

Lastly, I'd like to close with the following quote from James Bama:

Some features include peer-to-peer lending using BRC20, cross-chain support, and community governance where token holders can participate in decisions. There’s also an insurance and CDS derivatives layer, which could add some security for lending activities.

They've partnered with BTC Layer 2 projects to supply stablecoins and other DeFi products, so it seems there’s some ecosystem development happening around it.

[NanoGPT October Update](https://preview.redd.it/ewjos31fm8yd1.png?width=1820&format=png&auto=webp&s=3074dd54fd685b437632921a80bc0b06ee162029)

# New Text Models

A lot of text models have been added. **Grok**, the model that Twitter/X uses, was a much-requested model and we've now got access to it. The **Claude 3.5 Sonnet** upgrade was a surprise but a welcome one, most of our users report it being a large improvement particularly in terms of coding skills. Meta released **Llama 3.2 Medium** which significantly improves on Llama 3.1 while being cheaper at the same time.

Following many requests for **roleplaying and storytelling models** we added a whole range of models that are less censored and more tailored towards this specific purpose. WizardLM, Lumimaid, Magnum and EVA Qwen 2.5 are all models that are more open to generating content that is more creative and quite uncensored, and these along with a few more have been added to a new ""Roleplay/Storytelling"" category.

[Roleplaying models](https://preview.redd.it/qzeu42ofm8yd1.png?width=1820&format=png&auto=webp&s=8f6b892ae0f8d7ed76781c90fff74ca2188901c7)

# New Image Models

It was a good month for image models. **Ideogram V2** and Ideogram V2 Turbo scored very high on the image model rankings and we were requested to add these particularly for how good they are at putting text in images.

That said, Ideogram, according to most, got overtaken by **Flux Pro V1.1 Pro** when it came out. Flux Pro V1.1 is an upgrade over Flux Pro which was already a great model, and now generates faster, at lower cost, with better quality. It topped the leaderboards for a few days and it's a model that we had a lot of fun with right away.

The original Stable Diffusion models saw a big upgrade as well with the release of **Stable Diffusion 3.5** Large and Stable Diffusion 3.5 Turbo . These are Stability's strongest models yet and are very efficient, but frankly are not the models we would recommend most use.

This became even more true with the release of **Recraft V3**. Recraft V3 crushed the leaderboards and is now our default and recommended image model. It does text in images perfectly most of the times, has a lot of variety in styles to use, is very fast and priced the same as Flux Pro V1.1. All the images in this post were generated with Recraft V3 with zero manual edits.

[Recraft V3 now supported](https://preview.redd.it/z7x2zb2mm8yd1.png?width=1820&format=png&auto=webp&s=701dd43aea508a90af064ffa3afc651efe6fc751)

All in all we're constantly impressed with the quality of image models that are being released, we're happy to support them all on NanoGPT and we're looking forward to seeing what comes next. It really feels as if we're reaching a point where these image models are perfect, but we're also half expecting to see even better models next month again.

# New Payment Methods

Our aim has always been to provide access to AI text and image models to *everyone*, and we're happy to say that we've now added support for a lot of different payment methods to make this a reality.

The majority of the world uses **credit cards** for online payments, and we now support them for all those that don't have crypto. Previously it used to be the case that our users would invite friends and family to NanoGPT using crypto, but then those friends and family would be unable to add funds after that initial gift. We're happy to open up to more people this way, though we offer [a discount in crypto](https://nano-gpt.com/blog/why-we-use-nano) since we believe it's a better payment method.

We've also expanded our support for crypto payment methods. A privacy-oriented service like ours is a natural match for **Monero**, and Monero was the most requested coin to be added to NanoGPT. We've added Monero via BTCPayServer which we want to give a shout out to, they're a great service and make it very easy to implement more crypto payment methods.

In the same vein we've added **Litecoin**. Litecoin is the most used payment method on many services as BitPay often reports, and it's an OG in terms of doing payments in crypto.

Finally we've added **Dash**. Dash is focused on making payments in crypto easy with instant confirmations and low fees, and the community truly cares about it being used as a payment method rather than just speculation.

Starting next month we intend to release **usage statistics** similar to what BitPay does so that users can see how much the different cryptocurrencies are used. If other services are interested in details on how we implemented these different coins and on how they can do the same we're happy to share. The end-goal is a circular economy where more people can earn crypto and spend crypto without having to go through centralized providers, and we can only get there together.

[XMR Dash LTC](https://preview.redd.it/ra2pfzumm8yd1.png?width=1820&format=png&auto=webp&s=f8a8508a78e66b20df532eeeda4da4f0d94cdcbf)

# Media

We released our [blog](https://nano-gpt.com/blog) this month, with an article about [why we prefer payments in Nano](https://nano-gpt.com/blog/why-we-use-nano) and an article about [why we use Nano as our store of value](https://nano-gpt.com/blog/why-nano-is-our-store-of-value).

We also started doing podcasts since we believe they're a great way for people to get to know about nano and NanoGPT. We joined Keyword Crypto ([Youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SIRO9k56lZ0), [Spotify](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6S2MQ8mSakiLyQAoMo2mYB)) to talk about Nano, NanoGPT, Bitcoin's issues and central banks. We joined [Litecoin Underground](https://x.com/i/broadcasts/1lPKqOyaLpEJb) to talk about us adding Litecoin, about crypto decentralization, trying out NanoGPT with Litecoin and much more. Finally we talked to Joel Valenzuela ([Youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4zDn141bupw), [Twitter](https://x.com/TheDesertLynx/status/1852016704987001270)) about NanoGPT, privacy and censorship, CBDCs and crypto adoption.

There's also a podcast with someone from BCH coming up - would love to talk more to the BCH community so if there's some place we can chat I'd love to hear.

[Podcasting wizards](https://preview.redd.it/6t5untmnm8yd1.png?width=1820&format=png&auto=webp&s=2de6109eae93701d6491f20bbac98a7dc7f63a9f)

# Other

Last but not least, we added a bunch of small improvements.

Our [**Earn**](https://nano-gpt.com/earn) page has been expanded with more options. We've added Get-XNO, KarmaCall, XMRChat, [Moneromarket.io](http://Moneromarket.io), XMRBazaar, and Monezon. Suggestions for more options are always welcome, especially for BCH related ways to earn since we don't really have those yet - reach out to us.

Our image model selection has been simplified. We now rank image models by their scoring on independent leaderboards and have moved some of the models into a ""more"" section to keep the overview clear but still give you access to all models.

Since we've seen so much usage of image generation we added more image generation features. It's now possible to customize your prompting through advanced settings, the icon next to the resolution setting. This allows you to for example set a specific style to use on Recraft V3, to add ""negative prompts"" (""avoid this"") to many models, or to decide how much freedom to give the model in what it will create for you.

In a similar vein we simplified the text model selection. We're constantly balancing between wanting to give you access to all the models and on the other hand wanting to keep model choice simple. We're therefore now showing fewer models in the dropdown, and have moved a lot of extra models into the ""roleplaying"" and ""more"" sections. We've also added the ability to determine the visibility and categories of text models for yourself in ""[Settings](https://nano-gpt.com/settings)"", so that if you prefer to see Claude 3.5 Sonnet but not ChatGPT you can now easily do so.

As a final update we've made our [API](https://nano-gpt.com/api) fully OpenAI compatible. This means that you can now swap out OpenAI for NanoGPT as your LLM provider without having to change any of your code. You keep the functionality you're used to from OpenAI, but get access to a lot of extra models.

**Thanks for reading our update, thanks for using NanoGPT and for your support, and as always: more is coming.**

[As always, more coming](https://preview.redd.it/n8w289bom8yd1.png?width=1820&format=png&auto=webp&s=ef0e9c75dcb10b8ce233136ca57175507995a2b0)

2024-11-01 07:22:02,"The effects on block data transfer of prioritizing ""old-enough"" transactions when building blocks","Had this thought:

Full nodes already re-assemble blocks based _mostly_ on transactions they already have (with protocols like CB, XThin or Graphene).

If miners were to prioritize including older transactions, then the efficiency of these protocols would increase, because they would've already seen almost all the transactions, even under high network load.

It would also be a policy which is good for the users of the network because the longer your transaction has been around, the more likely it would be included in the next block, if miners were to adopt such a common approach.

It would have a cost to nodes in terms of tracking when a transaction has first been seen by them. This might become large if the mempool is big, but so far the mempool and block sizes are very small compared to the memory sizes of commodity computers.

_EDIT: It would be a simple thing to get rid of such a policy again if the implementation costs on memory were to become too big, but I personally don't think that will ever become the case - transactions are already a couple hundred bytes by themselves, and a node-internal timestamp for bookkeeping wouldn't add much mempool overhead. Max 4 bytes/tx, maybe even less if implemented cleverly._

_EDIT2: Some current node software (like BCHN) already maintains the timestamp of when a transaction entered the mempool. I think this lends itself nicely to an experiment!_",8,4,LovelyDayHere,btc
2024-11-01 04:25:41,Where do you see the future of Bitcoin Cash?,"Of course these are all speculative assets though as with anything, some (usually the loudest voices) have unshakable opinions on these matters and will claim their stance is the “truth” by a landslide.  I’m not here to try provoking anyone’s beliefs, nor am I here to get “anything”-pilled.  I just want to hear from people in an un-censored and chill type of way.  Below is my own answer to my own question with a bit of an explanation of where I’ve been at in the crypto space.

I went back and forth for quite a while on whether or not I better liked the idea of Bitcoin or Bitcoin Cash being the dominant iteration.  For one reason or another (mostly due to me buying into Monero instead which I still love), I never invested in Bitcoin Cash until recently.  In my mind, to be *the* store of value by which all others are measured it has to be the one most everyone agrees on, which unfortunately is by far and away Bitcoin Core.  I believe Bitcoin Core is becoming more and more of an abhorrence to Satoshi’s vision, and correspondingly more the new unit for banks and institutions to deal in and rule.
  That being said, the majority of my crypto holdings by dollar amount are in it… I don’t really like it, but the common folk is so reluctant to learn anything about how any of this works and the very same big names that relied on that line of thinking before are catering to it all the more by pretending you’re like a rebel or something by purchasing Bitcoin Core.  As time goes on I see it more as my responsibility to help in furthering the narrative away from institutional control, and I know this community hasn’t given up either.  
  I’ve seen the bitcore narrative change from “sound digital money” to “store of value” and the small steps in between.  Currently they’re still saying “not your keys not your coins” but I believe it’s only a matter of time until that changes to “you’re an extremist if you don’t trust your bank with your coins”.  I don’t know what the future holds, but I have hope that we can somehow display the superiority in using Bitcoin Cash over Bitcoin Core.  Even though I am invested with a higher dollar amount in Bitcore, I would love to see it trade market caps with Bcash not only because I own proportionally more of it but because we will have won against the pretend opposition of financial oppression.",10,94,DastardlyWarthog,btc

2024-10-25 16:35:45,Is encryption prior to decryption (and ultimately a stronger force)?,"Building off my last post - for my podcast this week, we started reading Cypherpunks: Freedom and the Future of The Internet by Julian Assange (et al.). In it, Assange suggests that encryption is actually a stronger force than decryption and will essentially remain a step ahead due to it being the natural state of the universe. Building from there, he suggests that this is the reason crypto technologies will be the path to freedom from authoritarian governments. So even as authoritarians figure out hoe to decrypt some old technology, new encrypted technologies will emerge.

I think there is something deep to this idea. However, I don't have any idea if it is actually 'true', but I do enjoy the optimism of it.

What do you think?

>The universe believes in encryption. It is easier to encrypt information than it is to decrypt it.  
We saw we could use this strange property to create the laws of a new world....And in this manner to declare independence.

>Scientists in the Manhattan Project discovered that the uni- verse permitted the construction of a nuclear bomb. This was not an obvious conclusion. Perhaps nuclear weapons were not within the laws of physics. However, the universe believes in atomic bombs and nuclear reactors. They are a phenomenon the universe blesses, like salt, sea or stars.

>Similarly, the universe, our physical universe, has that property that makes it possible for an individual or a group of individuals to reliably, automatically, even without knowing, encipher something, so that all the resources and all the political will of the strongest super- power on earth may not decipher it. And the paths of encipherment between people can mesh together to create regions free from the coercive force of the outer state. Free from mass interception. Free from state control. (Assange - Cypherpunks: Freedom and the Future of The Internet)

We're coming up on one week to go on the BCHC app indexer [Flipstarter](https://flipstarter.paybutton.org/) for anyone who wants to support the effort to make it much easier to run (only requiring one running node instead of two) and also ensuring proper support for CashTokens.

[PayButton](https://paybutton.org/) is the first app on BCH that leverages [BCHC](https://github.com/PayButton/bchc). PayButton is a great example of where BCHD (the indexer previously used) was unable to keep up with with the demands of the application due to the volume of transactions that often needs to be processed. We did a performance comparison between the two [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/1eqp1p2/indexer_performance_compared_bchd_vs_bchc/).

If you want to see it in action, you can test it out on the [PayButton Donation page](https://donate.paybutton.org/).

BCHC will also be setup to act as an alternative Electron Cash server. One notable difference between BCHC and Fulcrum is the ability to do paging, so apps that don't need to view all transactions at once (wallets being a good example) can grab just the latest ones to return results much faster and using less data.

We've also setup a BCHC operator's Telegram channel (@BCHCOps).

We think this is a big upgrade over what's out there right now and look forward to getting more apps using it.

If you want to test our our public instance, you can create an app using https://www.npmjs.com/package/chronik-client and put `https://bch.paybutton.org` in as the ChronikClient URL.

Feel free to ask any questions if you're curious.",12,0,KillerHurdz,btc

2024-10-23 06:30:15,Are crypto technologies the ultimate way out of authoritarianism?,"For my latest podcast, I read some early cypherpunk texts, including Wei Dai's ""B-Money"" where he describes how crypto-anarchy created out of alternative forms of money that will be untraceable and unregulatable.

I personally find this idea very exciting - not to mention impressively prescient, given that it was written in 1998 - in that a mode of community cooperation that exits the government system seems like the only way to rid ourselves of the current levels of authoritarianism experienced globally.

I also see this as the true power and implication of crypto technologies - not a get rich scheme, but rather a true anarchic exit of existing power structures.

>Unlike the communities traditionally associated with the word ""anarchy"", in a crypto-anarchy the government is not temporarily destroyed but permanently forbidden and permanently unnecessary. It's a community where the threat of violence is impotent because violence is impossible, and violence is impossible because its participants cannot be linked to their true names or physical locations.

>Until now it's not clear, even theoretically, how such a community could operate. A community is defined by the cooperation of its participants, and efficient cooperation requires a medium of exchange (money) and a way to enforce contracts. Traditionally these services have been provided by the government or government sponsored institutions and only to legal entities. In this article I describe a protocol by which these services can be provided to and by untraceable entities. (W. Dai - B-Money)

2024-10-21 12:00:00,"NanoGPT update: accounts, credit cards, Nano treasury, crypto discount, blog","I realise the previous update was fairly recent, but this one warrants one of its own since it's probably our biggest update so far:

**Optional accounts so you never lose your balance again**

The option for an account has been one of our most requested features.

Creating an account means you can log in and use your balance from any device anytime, and keep access to your balance when you clear cookies. We store only your email address with the associated Nano account. To be 100% clear: we do *not* store conversations or prompts, and if we start offering this option within accounts we will be very clear about it.

You can sign in with any random email, Google, or Github. You can of course also still use our service without an account.

**Credit card payments**

We intend to make our service available as broadly as possible.

The majority of the world does not use crypto yet, and many do use credit cards. Our service is for everyone.

By offering crypto *and* credit card payments + optional accounts we make access to the top text and image AIs easy and accessible. Not just for us techies here on Reddit, but also for your parents and aunt who think cookies are for eating and crypto is a scam.

There's a lot to dislike about credit card payments. We wrote a whole blog post about it, but the link gets this post removed it seems hah. They're extremely expensive, slow, and we get paid in inflationary fiat.

**5% discount on crypto**

The credit card downsides are why we're putting a 5% discount on all crypto payments. This will convince at least some people that pay using credit cards to look into Nano to save money.

**Blog**

We've added a blog to our website, with the first post being about why we prefer payments in Nano. This allows us to educate people who presumably don't know much about crypto, and we'll link to this when someone clicks ""add with Nano"" so that we can explain why we think it's such a great payment option.

**Nano treasury**

Finally and probably less popular on this subreddit but an update's an update: we intend to convert our profits to Nano.

Nano is not just a fantastic way to *transfer* value, we also see it as fundamentally the strongest *store* of value. I've written on this before (Google ""Senatus Substack Store of Value"" if you're interested, link gets removed), we'll also publish a blog on our reasoning soon.

Since we're profitable and need to store our profits in something, we've chosen to use Nano for it. We can't think of anything better suited to be our treasury.

----------------

As always there's more coming, but this addition feels like a big step. Next up on our improvement list is more crypto options, the ability to add files into the chat, and more and more and more.

Thanks to all of you for your support and feedback so far.

I unknowingly copied that address and sent the BTC I just received from my BTC cash app withdrawal, back to the same address. 

Cash app BTC ""specialists"" are trying to claim that the address I sent the BTC to, does not belong to cash app.

From my understanding BTC withdrawals from cash app work like this. 

A customer requests a BTC withdrawal on cash app. 

Cash app sends the BTC to a BTC hot wallet owned by cash app used to facilitate customer withdrawals. 

Then the BTC is transferred to the BTC wallet address requested by the customer. 

But am I missing something? 

I'm confused by all the different input and output addresses on the transaction. 

On the transaction id on mempool there's over a hundred different inputs totalling over 1.5 BTC. 

I'm assuming cash app uses these hot wallets to send multiple customers withdrawals at the same time to cut cost of fees? 

But there's no way that I would receive the BTC withdrawal from cash app from some random address unrelated to cash app right? 

Here's all the details.

They droned on about decentralization, tried to scam people into using their proprietary Liquid sidechain, and kept saying Lightning Network would be ready in ""18 more months"". So here we are in 2024, Lightning is officially dead, Bitcoin fees are ridiculously high, the BTC network is slow, and Segwit is totally unnecessary. Taproot seems mostly pointless as it simply enabled more tracking, and there was a bug which allowed ordinals to clog up the chain. Is there anyone who believes that Blockstream is doing anything useful with the Bitcoin code?   

So would it be possible to fire Blockstream and the Bitcoin Core dev team? Could another team code a BTC hard fork that rolls back Segwit and increases the blocksize limit? Could that fork become a new and improved BTC if a majority of miners agreed to it? Surely exchanges and other stakeholders would be happy if fees were cut 100x, capacity was improved 100x, and the network sped up? ",13,134,Kallen501,btc

Footage of El Salvador's Bukele addressing crowds about Bitcoin adoption in his country is intercut with footage of Prince Phillip of Serbia meeting with Mow. 

  
Bitcoin Maximalism is lightly ridiculed by the film, but any coins other than Bitcoin are treated as scams. Ethereum is roasted for producing a ""Scambrian Explosion"" of NFTs and ERC20 tokens. When the subject of the Blocksize War emerges, Blockstream is introduced as the saviors of Bitcoin (which had me screaming at the screen). Interestingly, Adam Back and Peter Todd discuss why Peter Todd was never made an employee of Blockstream, saying it ""would've been suspicious"". In a glaring omission, the Lightning Network is never mentioned in the film. Those who lived through the Blocksize War know that Lightning was touted as the ""preferred scaling solution for Bitcoin"", which has unfortunately failed completely. The Bitcoin Cash fork is notably absent from the film. Roger Ver does appear in the film, and he discusses CIA and NSA infiltration of the project. Peter Todd's email leak comes up in the film, and Todd is questioned about his interactions with ""J Dillon"", his CIA handler during the development of RBF (replace by fee). 

  
Hoback's conclusion that Peter Todd is Satoshi is based on a 2010 Bitcointalk post in which Todd appears to complete Satoshi's thought. Hardly a smoking gun. It is claimed by Todd's defenders that Todd was only 15 years old at the time and was ""working on a fine arts degree"". Todd does seem to be nervous when he's accused of being Satoshi, and it's certainly possible that he is part of the Satoshi identity, if it was shared amongst several people. Ultimately Hoback concludes that Todd fabricated the email leak, but there's really no evidence of it. Furthermore it's unclear why Todd would fabricate the leak. 



Hoback couldn't secure an interview with Greg Maxwell, who is said to be suffering from continued harassment from the crypto commmunity. Todd says Greg ""doesn't leave the house much"". So at least there is some good news :). The most ridiculous part of the film is when ""Satoshi reappears"" and sends an email saying he ""supports Blockstream"" on keeping blocks small. 

  
All in all, ""Money Electric: The Bitcoin Mystery"" is a good documentary even if it fails to conclusively find Satoshi's identity.  Adam Back and Peter Todd's words will continue to be analyzed for any ""tells"", and Samson Mow decisively proves he's not particularly bright. The exclusion of Bitcoin Cash and all cryptocurrencies other than BTC merely shows the low level of intellect in the BTC Maxi community. ",5,5,Kallen501,btc

2024-10-14 18:54:19,A more sensible way to measure market dominance of an electronic payment system:,"LESS USEFUL: ""value"" of the system accounting units priced in some fiat currencies

MORE USEFUL: fraction of global commerce transacted in the system, e.g.

- percentage of the number of transactions over number of all global transactions in same timeframe

- percentage of value transacted in some timeframe compared to the other common payment & settlement methods (maybe bring everything into a common unit of account e.g. via gold price)

There would be difficulty working these out. Statistics and surveying would need to be used.

But let's be honest - in today's world, the results would not (yet) be flattering for crypto ""currency"".

And it might surprise that coins ranked highly according to the current dollar price based market cap metric may rank much lower if looked at through the above glasses.

Now, if A and B are comparably good money, and legal to use in commerce, a merchant should not care much whether they get paid in A or B.

All things being equal, this should help a free market select against the worse forms of money and migrate to the better ones.

Of course, things are not equal - there is the famous _network effect_ of money that factors extremely heavily.

But that - the actual network effect - is much better captured through evaluating the percentage of actual commercial transactions done with some money, rather than using the manipulable statistic of its supply capitalization via heavily inflated fiat.",8,2,LovelyDayHere,btc

2024-10-13 12:24:05,Nobody cares about your project’s whitepaper or tech specs,"Had an opportunity to interview Cointelegraph's reporter Tom Mitchelhill on how to get people to take you seriously in crypto.

**Stop selling your product and start selling the problem**

At least not at first. Crypto is littered with bold claims and half-baked promises. “Our platform will revolutionize DeFi!” or “We’ll achieve 10x returns in the first year!”, ""We're launching a token, keep it between us though"" Yeah, heard it all before. And guess what? Journalists have too. If there’s one thing that will make you radioactive to the media and investors alike, it’s hype without substance.Tom has seen too many crypto companies overpromise and underdeliver. My take on it is you need to build credibility slowly and let your results speak for themselves. No one’s saying you shouldn’t be ambitious, but if you can’t back up your claims, don’t make them.

  
Remember the Bitconnect fiasco? (you gotta [watch this priceless moment](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vabXXkZjKiw)); The company promised insane returns but couldn’t back up any of its claims. It ended up being a [Ponzi scheme](https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/crypto-fraud-victims-receive-over-17-million-restitution-bitconnect-scheme). On the other hand, take Chainlink Labs, which focused on solving a specific problem without grandiose promises. They started small, delivered results, and are now one of the top projects in the space (I wasn't paid for this mention, I swear).

**Flux Pro V1.1** has replaced Flux Pro as the default image model. Flux Pro V1.1 is genuinely incredible, beating out all other image models in blind (hah) tests, including against MidJourney. Give it a try and see how amazing it is. It also is the image model that X Premium uses by default (together with Flux Schnell).

[Flux Pro V1.1 example image](https://preview.redd.it/ku2pl8tlbhud1.png?width=1024&format=png&auto=webp&s=e9863dc1344da7048579bdabeef1d8226a9b8d2f)

**Discord and Telegram bots are available to add into your chats**. These bots set up a group wallet that anyone can add to, and then anyone in the group can generate images. Admins can set the default image model, decide whether it should be censored and uncensored, and more. Telegram Bot: u/NanoGPTCom_bot, the Discord Bot I can't link here unfortunately so will try in a comment (or DM me!).

**Magic prompting makes it easier to create beautiful images.** Type something in the input area, hit ""improve prompt"" and let one of our LLMs improve your prompt. You can accept or reject the suggestion and refine it further if you prefer!

**An entire category of Roleplay/Storytellijng models is available.** All the best storytelling models are available, with most being very much uncensored. This has been a much-requested addition, if there are requests for additional models we'd love to hear and will gladly add.NanoGPT update: Grok, Telegram/Discord bots, Flux Pro V1.1, magic prompting and more

some of the maxis think that exchanging eCash notes creates enough privacy to overthrow the main privacy coin you've all heard of, and they are even suggesting that certain markets you have heard of should switch to Fedimint. they are wrong in two places, 1) nobody is going to do this type of electronic commerce with this level of trusted custody and, 2) a mint doesn't have a huge anonymity set like the main privacy coin out there. when mints are small you can trust fewer people not to rug you, but when they get big enough to provide a decent anonymity set, just forget it. other maxis are insisting that Fedimint is fine for pocket change amounts, but then it will never actually be able to handle the volume required for this level of electronic commerce.

the maxis who celebrate Fedimint believe opposite things. on the one hand, they worship BTC because they think it is impossible to inflate the 21M supply, and the high hashrate protects it from all dangers. this makes it the best thing out there. on the other hand, they believe that most people should be shoved into a custodial fedimint where BTC IOUs can be printed out of thin air and proof of work doesn't matter. it's a tacit admission that lightning isn't scaling bitcoin, and the next logical step is that bitcoin can't both scale and give all its users self-custody, so they are tossing self-custody. they are also tossing inflation protection and proof of work because why quit while you're ahead.

* eCashers think that proof of work is not needed and you can rely on only trust
* eCashers think that no code is necessary to prevent double spending
* eCashers think that fractional reserve banking is not a big deal
* eCashers think that the 21M limit is not important
* eCashers are funded by Blockstream according to https://fedimint.org/

- ... RBF (basically destroying the cash-like nature and a central property of Bitcoin -- the irreversability of transactions -- mentioned in the whitepaper),
- ... proposing supply inflation as a means to solve the coming network security issue due to BTC's crippled blocksize, 
- ... supporting the crippling of the blocksize in the first place (i.e. going directly against Satoshi's advice to increase the blocksize once blocks became full in 2016),
- ... working with a claimed USG agent to propagandize against bigger blocks,
- ... supporting the LN non-solution which everyone with a brain told them would not be able to scale in the right way (it can't on a 7 tps base layer - that's even documented in the LN whitepaper lol),

2024-10-08 14:40:44,U.S. spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs),"📰 Bitcoin ETFs Rebound with a $235 Million Boom! 🚀💰

By Bitlender, Investigative Blogger/Technical Analyst

Get ready, crypto lovers! 🤑 Bitcoin is back in action as U.S. spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) saw a whopping $235.19 million in inflows on Monday, making up for the net outflows we saw last week! 😲📈 Hold onto your seats because the crypto world is never short of surprises! 🎢

What’s Happening? 🤔

According to The Block, Fidelity (BATS:FBTC) was the frontrunner, bagging $103.68 million in fresh inflows. 💸 Not far behind, BlackRock (NASDAQ:IBIT), the biggest player in Bitcoin ETFs, pulled in $97.88 million. 🏆

Bitwise (BATS:BITB) wasn’t left out either, attracting $13.09 million, while Ark Invest and 21Shares (BATS:ARKB) teamed up for $12.63 million in fresh cash. 🤑🔥

VanEck (BATS:HODL) and Invesco (BATS:BTCO) also got their slice of the pie, adding $5.37 million and $2.53 million, respectively. 🍰 Meanwhile, Grayscale (OTC:GBTC) and six other ETFs… well, they reported zero inflows. Oops! 😅

Despite all the drama, the total trading volume for these ETFs hit $1.22 billion, showing that the market is heating up again! 🔥💥

Ethereum, Where You At? 🤨

While Bitcoin ETFs were having a field day, Ethereum ETFs took a breather, reporting no inflows on Monday. It’s like they decided to take a vacation! 😎🌴 This came after mixed results last week, where Ethereum struggled to keep the momentum going.

Even with all this activity, Bitcoin’s price dipped 1.4% to $62,457, while Ethereum also dropped 1.3% to $2,442. Ouch! 😬💔 But hey, it’s crypto—ups and downs are all part of the game! 🎢

Why Does It Matter? 💡

Here’s where things get juicy! On Monday, MicroStrategy (NASDAQ:MSTR) reached a six-month high, even while Bitcoin’s price was wrestling with a key moving average. It’s like MicroStrategy just decided to party on its own! 🎉💼

At the same time, the S&P 500 and Nasdaq both took a hit, dropping by more than 1% in the afternoon. 📉 And just when we thought things couldn’t get crazier, the Volatility Index (VIX) spiked by 19%, hitting its highest point in a month. 😱

Analysts Speak Out 🎤

The folks at QCP Capital said that Bitcoin’s “Uptober” is back on track, driven by macroeconomic factors keeping Bitcoin above the $60,000 level. 🎯 But don’t get too comfortable! They warned that Thursday’s CPI report will be a key moment that could swing Bitcoin’s price either way. ⚠️

What’s Next? 👀

Everyone’s eyes are now on Thursday’s CPI report, which could determine whether Bitcoin keeps rising or faces more turbulence. Will “Uptober” continue, or are we in for a bumpy ride? 🚀📉 Stay tuned to find out!

2024-10-05 08:44:56," I used to think that the BTC security model is in trouble, I was so wrong! /s ","https://preview.redd.it/i43sc84jewsd1.jpg?width=1400&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=671486e7f468c1747b9417e4b169edd447782195

An overview of how it works first. On BTC, miners work to create blocks using a proof of work.

The miners keep each other in check so that if some tiny miner decides to produce bad blocks, the rest of the network will just ignore the rogue miner.

The trouble is that when the majority of the network becomes rogue, and you can have a 51% attack.

**What could a 51% attack look like?**

Imagine that you sell your motorbike and receive some coins in exchange. You check the blockchain, coins received, and all is well.

As soon as the buyer is gone with your bike, you check the blockchain again, and oops! Your coin is gone!

80% of the miners decided to collude, re-mine the latest blocks, remove the transaction where you received the coins, and replace that with a bribe from the motorbike thief.

You are left there, bamboozled, with no bike and no coin...

This attack would be catastrophic for the network and erode the trust people place in it. It is fortunately  hard to pull off because you need a majority of the hashrate for that.

You could buy 10 million USD or 20 million USD of equipment to mine, but that still wouldn't get you to 51% of the BTC hash rate.

Of course, if you had unlimited resources like a magician, you could print out mining rigs like there is no tomorrow and then overtake the network. But you are not that rich.

So, it's the economic cost of overtaking the network that protects it from the collusion of bad miners.

It would be so much cheaper and simpler for bad actors to attack if more and more miners just stopped mining!

**Why do the miners keep mining anyway?**

For the money! They buy cheap equipment, use cheap energy to produce blocks, and receive mining rewards. With the rewards, they pay back the equipment and the energy and then keep a profit.

As long as this business is profitable, the hashrate of the miners stays the same or increases.

What happens when the block reward is reduced?

Nothing at first, but if it is reduced too much, the reward is no longer enough to cover the energy and equipment costs, and then the miners start shutting down some of their units.

They are not in it for the tech; remember, they want to make money. They will shut down mining rigs unless the price of the coin has increased and the new price is enough to cover their costs.

On BTC, every 4 years, the block reward is divided by 2. If the price of BTC stays the same during that time, it means that mining brings half as much revenue every 4 years, so it's rapidly going to zero.

For example, if the miners are at break-even in a given year, 4 years later they will receive half as much money for their work, so they will have a 50% loss.

If somehow the price of BTC managed to double by that time, the miners would be back at break-even, but they might fear what will happen after 4 more years.

As the block reward keeps dropping and there are not nearly enough transaction fees to compensate, the BTC hashrate is going to drop more and more, and at some point the bad actors will be able to pull off their motorbike heist.

This was my understanding of the troubles of the BTC security model until very recently.

That is, until I read **""Highjacking Bitcoin"" by Roger Ver**.

The book explains how bitcoin was captured by the bitcoin core developers and their company, Blockstream. It's an interesting read, and I highly suggest you give it a look.

**Why does it matter?**

My understanding of the book is that now that Blockstream controls the code of the project, the main discussion spaces of its community,  the BTC ticker, the 'Bitcoin' brand, and it is no longer challenged as to how to update the BTC protocol.

They have effectively become the masters of BTC.

They can steer it how they see fit. Roger gives the example of the Liquid Network as their proprietary alternative to the troubled bitcoin network.

This centralization of power could be very 'useful' if the miners have a problem (the mining rewards are too low) or if the miners ever become a problem.

During the civil war, the miners had the power to choose the new King. At that time, everyone agreed that bitcoin was the chain with the most POW, starting from the genesis block of Satoshi.

If Bitcoin Cash had been able to divert enough miners to it, it would have won the BTC ticker and the Bitcoin brand. Bitcoin Cash didn't win, and nowadays, the consensus is changing to ""Bitcoin is what the Bitcoin core developers are working on"".

The subtle difference is that if there is a problem, the core developers could decide to update the protocol and sideline the miners that don't fit their vision.

What happens if the block reward and transaction fees are systemically too low for too long?

Let's imagine a scenario where the number of miners decreases and the hashrate fluctuates violently. The core developers then decide to protect the network by updating the protocol rules so that only serious miners can continue mining.

The result would be that only the ones aligned with the core developers will remain.

This is drastically different from a few years ago, where the miners were still the kingmakers.

**How does this change the security model of BTC?**

BTC now has a king, and its name is Blockstream.

The king does not want to die, and it will take actions to avoid that.

BlockStream will never let the miners close shop en masse if it endangers the whole network they control.

The network will survive, with or without miners, because it's the foundation of the power of the king.

Granted, for me and you peasants and humble farmers, getting value out of it will probably involve a fair bit of grovelling, frantic begging and pleading for mercy to our new overlords,

but hey! The Number will Go Up!

That includes

- developers
- miners
- holders of large currency stakes (who generally might influence or even partly own the above)

Bitcoin having been created and maintained as a protocol built on open source, is capable of slipping attempts to grasp control of it through the forkability of its components.

There can be competing ""Bitcoins"" - protocols deriving from the common ancestor.

They may be known under distinct names and tickers, such as 'Bitcoin Cash' (BCH) in order to provide the market with more information about themselves.

To provide continued resilience against capture, they continue being open source protocols, free to anyone to use and modify.

Soundness of the original money (Bitcoin) is not harmed in general by currency splits which preserve holder equity.

The upgrade is in ~8 months, lock in is 50 days away. We're asking for reviews and feedback from all Bitcoin Cash users, businesses, and developers.

Ask Me Anything!

---

The Limits and BigInt CHIPs would allow developers to do **far more with Bitcoin Cash contracts**:

- **Simpler, easy-to-audit math** – reducing transaction sizes, like the [Jedex](https://blog.bitjson.com/jedex-decentralized-exchanges-on-bitcoin-cash/) market maker contract, by hundreds of bytes. With this upgrade, contracts like these could use fewer bytes than single-signature addresses, as is [already possible with other contracts](https://x.com/bitjson/status/1542578383720271873). A number of BCH DeFi projects (e.g. Jedex) are currently tied down by the cost and complexity of carefully implementing and auditing specific emulations of high-precision math. Worse, contracts which successfully clear this development obstacle, ultimately waste bandwidth, block space, and node CPU utilization when compared to this upgrade's native math.
- **Larger stack items** – clearing the way for post-quantum cryptography, stronger escrow strategies, zero-knowledge proofs, and other important developments for the future security and competitiveness of Bitcoin Cash.
- **More than 201 opcodes** – While the CashTokens upgrade makes it technically possible to break contracts up into multiple parts, the somewhat arbitrary 201 opcode limit ([established by an emergency patch in 2010](https://gitlab.com/bitcoin-cash-node/bitcoin-cash-node/-/commit/757f0769d8360ea043f469f3a35f6ec204740446)) raises the cost of developing and deploying many contracts, forcing contract authors to remove important features or complicate otherwise simple contracts with a harder-to-audit, ""multi-input state machine"". This increases the cost of development and safety audits, and in some cases, it causes teams to abandon valuable product ideas.

___
How deep is the integration of anonymity networks like Tor and I2P in general.

My take is that the BCH community is largely ignoring or hand waving privacy risks, always pointing to CashFusion which reliably only works in one wallet (Electron Cash). It pains me to say this, but the state of privacy within BCH is miserable.

Who is willing to change this? Monero has great success funding its infrastructure through CCS and bounties. BCH has Flipstarter but it is rarely used for infrastructure projects or fixing bugs/privacy issues. The one infrastructure project that comes to my mind ""BCH<>XMR atomic swaps"" is taking ages?

I want to live the rest of my life in USA. Now the problem is how do i move the money from Myanmar to US so that I can finally buy a land/house for my own and say good-bye to my endless rent hunting.

Can I just buy a ton of bitcoin in like Binance and then take the money out in USA? Will it be considered legal money?

There is no way of bank to bank transfer from MM to USA since Myanmar Military Junta are short on dollars and have put lots of restrictions.

There is a hondi way(Third party way of transfer money. I dont think it is considered legal for this large amount?)

2024-09-25 06:30:59,"NanoGPT update: o1-preview, new models, model backups, api improvements, decentralized models, free models","We've been busy adding models. **o1-preview** and **o1-mini** are the newest OpenAI models which can ""think"". They are the new best models according to most comparisons, but come with a price tag to match.

**DeepSeek V2.5** is now available for API users, as are **Dolphin Mixtral 7x8b** and **Dolphin Mixtral 7x22b,** while the Gemini models for everyone were updated to the newest version as soon as this was possible.

We've also added redundancy. **Most models now have fallbacks** with other providers meaning models being unavailable should practically never happen anymore.

Other models that we've added, to the API only for now, are **Llama 3.1 8b decentralized** and **Llama 3.1 405b decentralized**. These are decentralized versions of Llama Small (which we don't show by default) and Llama Large (which is on our website). We've added these because we're always trying to improve and decentralized open source models *could* offer even better privacy and robustness.

The reason these are only on API for now is we're unsure just how well they work yet, so what we've done is made the prices for them extremely low and let people test it through API. If we see everything working well and get good feedback on them we might make them available in the dropdown menu soon. The dropdown menu is getting a bit oversized with all the options we have though, so we have to make choices there.

Last but not least we've added a **""free model"" option.** These models are not the best models but allow people to try out our service for free and work for simple questions. If people want better performance and use the state-of-the-art models they can always deposit a few cents to try that out, and see how they go!

As always thanks for the support and feedback, it's a rush every time someone reaches out to tell us they're getting value from our service or cares enough to give feedback. Those building stuff probably know there's no better feeling, so thanks.",21,10,Mirasenat,btc

In a crypto world where prices are dictated by market demand, how is Ripple (XRP) fundamentally more valuable than something like a meme coin (e.g., PEPE)? Let’s break it down:

Both XRP and PEPE seem top-heavy, meaning whales can heavily influence the market.

From the public’s perspective, they’re essentially just charts to follow and trade on.

So, what truly separates XRP from a ""shitcoin"" like PEPE? Is it just the hype, or is there a tangible, undeniable reason why XRP should hold more value?

I’m genuinely curious and open to learning, but I need it explained simply and clearly. No buzzwords, no hype—just the facts. Thanks in advance!

2024-12-05 12:26:23,Get ready to take profits,"Bitcoin for the first time has crossed $100,000! An amazing achievement but it's time to stay cautious.

This is my 3rd bull run and I learned the hard way. in 2017/18 I saw riches and then 6 months later everything was wiped out.

Here is my current take:

1. Bitcoin has little upside left in this cycle (max 40-50%).
2. ETH is your best bet right now. We will see a final aggressive altcoin season before a crash (approx 1-3 months away).
3. Institutions and whales are not your friends - when you only see good news online, not a good sign.
4. Retail money is already here, we will not see anything like 2021.
5. Crypto price manipulation is real and the charts can tell you a lot - look at the confluence between USDT dominance %, BTC dominance % and Crypto Market Total excl BTC.

I left the coin as I expect a 50% pullback like usual but the thing is that the market is looking super bullish and ready for alt szn.

2024-12-05 10:12:05,Vechain 🚀🚀🚀,"Why Buy VeChain (VET) Now at $0.07?

VeChain (VET) is not just another cryptocurrency; it’s a blockchain ecosystem with real-world use cases that position it uniquely for exponential growth. At its current price of $0.07, VeChain represents a rare opportunity to invest in a proven project at an undervalued stage. Here’s why VeChain could be one of the best investments in blockchain technology today, with the potential to reach $1:

1. Real-World Use Cases and Enterprise Adoption

VeChain has cemented itself as a leader in supply chain management and enterprise solutions, with partnerships spanning across global giants like PwC, BMW, Walmart China, and DNV GL. These partnerships validate VeChain’s value in ensuring transparency, efficiency, and traceability. With the global supply chain industry estimated to be worth $15 trillion by 2030, VeChain is poised to become a critical infrastructure provider.

2. Undervalued Market Cap

VeChain’s market cap of just $5 billion is a fraction of its true potential when compared to projects with similar real-world adoption. By solving billion-dollar inefficiencies in logistics, sustainability, and carbon tracking, VeChain is uniquely positioned to expand its market share. A price of $1 would only put VeChain’s market cap around $64 billion—a realistic target given its growth trajectory and enterprise partnerships.

3. Expanding Ecosystem

VeChain has moved beyond supply chain solutions, launching initiatives in DeFi, NFTs, and carbon credit tracking. This ecosystem expansion creates additional demand for VET tokens, driving up both utility and value. The launch of tools like VeCarbon for sustainability tracking aligns VeChain with ESG goals, a trillion-dollar investment trend that will attract institutional interest.

4. Favorable Macro Environment

As the global economy embraces blockchain for efficiency, VeChain stands out as one of the few projects with real-world adoption. Additionally, VeChain benefits from its low-cost, energy-efficient blockchain, positioning it as a sustainable choice for enterprises. With increased regulation favoring credible projects, VeChain’s enterprise-grade blockchain puts it ahead of competitors.

5. Path to $1

For VeChain to reach $1, it would need to 14x from its current price of $0.07. Consider these driving factors:
	•	Mass Adoption: Existing partnerships are just the beginning; as blockchain adoption accelerates, VeChain’s scalable solutions can onboard new industries.
	•	Supply Chain Revolution: With global businesses prioritizing transparency and traceability post-COVID, VeChain has a clear runway to dominate.
	•	Retail and Institutional Interest: The current price point makes VET attractive for both retail investors seeking high returns and institutions looking for blockchain exposure.

The Time to Act is Now

At $0.07, VeChain offers an entry point that many investors might look back on as a missed opportunity. The combination of real-world utility, growing adoption, and a global focus on sustainability makes VeChain a project with $1 in its sights. As the crypto market recovers and blockchain adoption accelerates, VeChain has the fundamentals to reward early investors handsomely.

2024-12-04 21:29:26,The Role of Bitcoin ETFs Amid Market Volatility,"Bruno Caratori concluded with insights into 2025’s market volatility and the implications of rising Bitcoin ETF demand for the broader crypto ecosystem.He acknowledged the challenges of predicting short-term price movements, pointing to Bitcoin’s rise to $90,000–$100,000—something that seemed far-fetched just a few months ago—as an example of market unpredictability.  
Caratori highlighted that as Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies continue to develop technologically and gain real-world utility, their growth prospects will rise dramatically.  


>If Bitcoin becomes indeed a store of value that is as meaningful as gold, it needs to be valued at at least a million dollars,

he stated.Caratori pointed out that the adoption of Bitcoin ETFs by institutional investors and brokers is **expected to drive further price growth.** Bitcoin’s scarcity contrasts sharply with the unlimited demand it could face.  
The presidential election has paved the way for significant changes in the crypto industry. With clearer regulations and a shift in political leadership, the sector seems poised for expansion.  
While market volatility remains an issue, crypto assets’ potential continues to capture the attention of both individual and institutional investors. Caratori stressed the importance of keeping a long-term outlook and monitoring regulatory and technological developments.

Hey everyone! Here’s a follow-up to my earlier analysis on ZRX/USDT. Let’s dive into how the price action and indicators have evolved since the last update and what might be ahead for ZRX in the coming weeks.

# Price Action & Moving Averages (Daily)

* **Current Price**: **$0.6700**, up **3.78%** today.
* **Key MAs**:
   * MA7: **$0.5876**
   * MA25: **$0.4668**
   * MA99: **$0.3522**

**Analysis**:  
The price has seen a strong upward push and is trading well above all the major moving averages on the daily chart. This signals robust bullish momentum across short, medium, and long time frames. All three MAs should now act as support levels if we see any retracements.

# Weekly Overview

* **Current Price**: **$0.6700**, up **12.80% this week**.
* **Key MAs (Weekly)**:
   * MA7: **$0.4377**
   * MA25: **$0.3567**
   * MA99: **$0.3445**

**Analysis**:  
The weekly chart shows the price continuing its climb, breaking through critical resistance zones established earlier this year. The bullish trend remains intact, with the price firmly above the moving averages, especially the short-term MA7.

# RSI (Relative Strength Index)

* **Daily RSI**:
   * RSI(6): **73.67** (Overbought territory)
* **Weekly RSI**:
   * RSI(8): **79.17**
   * RSI(14): **66.57**

**Analysis**:  
The RSI on the daily chart is now above **70**, indicating overbought conditions and a possible short-term pullback. However, the weekly RSI remains in bullish territory without being overly extended. This suggests strong momentum, though a cooling-off period may be on the horizon.

# MACD (Moving Average Convergence Divergence)

* **Daily MACD**:
   * MACD Line: **0.0643**
   * Signal Line: **0.0812**
   * Histogram: **0.0169**
* **Weekly MACD**:
   * MACD Line: **0.0119**
   * Signal Line: **0.0231**
   * Histogram: **0.0112**

**Analysis**:  
The daily MACD shows the histogram starting to flatten slightly, which could hint at momentum cooling. Meanwhile, on the weekly chart, the MACD continues its upward trajectory, confirming the bullish trend remains intact for now.

# Volume

* **Daily Volume**: Steady increase, reflecting growing buying interest.
* **Weekly Volume**: Positive and significantly higher compared to previous weeks.

**Analysis**:  
Volume remains supportive of the price action, which is a good confirmation of a genuine move. Sustained volume at these levels is a positive sign for further continuation.

# Key Levels to Watch

1. **Support**:
   * **Daily**: $0.5876 (MA7), $0.4668 (MA25)
   * **Weekly**: $0.4377 (MA7), $0.3567 (MA25)
2. **Resistance**:
   * **Daily**: $0.6928 (recent high)
   * **Weekly**: $0.7500 (major resistance from early 2023 highs)

# Conclusion

The bullish trend in ZRX/USDT continues to strengthen. Both the daily and weekly charts reflect solid momentum supported by price action, RSI, and MACD. However, the daily RSI entering overbought territory and a flattening histogram on the MACD hint at a potential short-term pullback before another leg higher.

**Outlook**:

* **Long-Term Bullish** in the long term, with targets around $2.20–$2.50.
* **Short-Term Bullish** in the medium term, with targets around $0.85–$0.95.
* **Caution**: A short-term correction is likely if RSI and MACD on the daily chart weaken further.",4,4,StockHodI,cryptomarkets
2024-12-03 12:32:47,Analyzing Current Market Trends and Impacts,"Bitcoin (BTC) continues to show its resilience, maintaining a strong position amidst market volatility. With recent price movements, we’re observing significant resistance levels around $98,000 and support near $90,000. Technical indicators suggest a possible breakout above $98,000 if volume spikes.These movements also impact other major assets like Dogecoin (DOGE), which often mirrors broader market sentiment. Traders should stay informed, as these shifts could signal opportunities.

Exchanges among other large market players have maximized these movements as seen in the likes of Bitget which is currently running campaigns aligned with trending coins. For instance, you can trade BTC, DOGE, and more to share in a pool of 400,000 DOGE airdrops.

Whether a trader or an investor, currently there are plenty of opportunities in the Crypto market.

How are you maximizing these times whether you are trading or holding potential coins?",1,0,AntonietteK,cryptomarkets

2024-12-04 01:15:50,How OriginTrail TRAC Uses AI to Build a Better World ,"Hey Redditors,

I wanted to start a discussion about how **OriginTrail (TRAC)**, a project many might associate with supply chains, is leveraging **Artificial Intelligence (AI)** to make a tangible impact on our world.

# What is OriginTrail?

At its core, OriginTrail is a **Decentralized Knowledge Graph (DKG)** that organizes and connects data from diverse ecosystems. It’s like a global brain for trusted data, allowing different sectors like supply chain, healthcare, and Web3 to interoperate seamlessly.

# The AI Angle

OriginTrail integrates **AI technologies** to extract meaningful insights from massive datasets while ensuring that these insights are **trustworthy and tamper-proof**. For example:

1. **Supply Chain Optimization**: AI models running on the DKG can predict disruptions and improve efficiency in logistics.
2. **Sustainability Monitoring**: AI-driven data analysis helps businesses meet compliance standards like carbon tracking, enabling real environmental impact.
3. **Healthcare Solutions**: In pharmaceuticals, OriginTrail ensures the authenticity of medicines while AI helps analyze and predict trends in data.

# Why It Matters

AI's potential is often limited by the **quality and trustworthiness of the data** it uses. OriginTrail’s DKG bridges this gap by ensuring data integrity and interoperability, making AI applications more reliable and impactful.

# Let’s Discuss

* **Have you come across other blockchain projects integrating AI like this?**
* **What’s your take on the role of trusted data in maximizing AI’s potential?**
* **Where else could OriginTrail's AI capabilities be applied?**

Looking forward to hearing your thoughts! ",29,18,snakeo087,cryptomarkets

The growth of Mina Protocol continues to accelerate, marking a significant achievement in network adoption. This milestone represents a remarkable 25% increase in total accounts since late 2023, when the network had just under 200,000 accounts\[.

**Why This Matters**

This rapid account growth demonstrates two key aspects of Mina's evolution:

1. Network Adoption: The surge in account creation reflects growing interest in Mina's unique 22kb blockchain architecture and zero-knowledge capabilities
2. Ecosystem Expansion: This growth aligns perfectly with Mina's upcoming developments, including:

**Looking Forward**

With the introduction of mobile proving support expected by February 2025 and new user growth incentives planned for early 2025, this account milestone could be just the beginning of Mina's expansion phase.

1. Ethereum Bridge Testing: The highly anticipated Ethereum-Mina Token Bridge is launching its community testing phase next week. This first iteration will allow users to bridge wrapped ETH between Ethereum and Mina networks.

I used to be involved with crypto a little while back, but didn't do particularly well and ended up cashing out everything, however I'm thinking to get back into it but want to start off on the right foot.

So, my question is; how do people keep track of how much money they're actually putting into crypto? I figured it's all good and well buying crypto whenever you can, but if you don't actually have an idea of how much fiat you're putting into it, it's kind of hard to discern how much you may be potentially making once it's time to cash back out.

I did also try and have the disciple to keep notes on paper in a diary but found it was a bit long winded especially if you're trying to make a spontaneous purchase when you're not at home etc.

So can anyone recommend any decent phone apps which might be good for tracking this, while simultaneously telling you how much cryptop you might be holding and what it's value is, in real time etc?

I traded in crypto during the pandemic mostly as a way to pass time and possibly make some extra money. I’m no pro! But I remember finding out about BitTorrent then and being really bullish on the utilisation of the coin at the time; which solely could have been because it was the easiest to understand for me being new to the whole crypto thing. Due to financial situations I haven’t touched crypto trading up until a few months ago but I’m surprised it hasn’t seen much love from current investors.

Now my assumptions are that it’s due to its insanely high circulating supply! (968 trillion). With that much supply out there it just can’t be in that high of a demand. Now I’d love to see it jump back up to that 1c mark like in 22’, but I don’t see how that can be remotely realistic with so much supply out there.

2024-12-02 21:38:20,Can anyone explain why LTC is not the most undervalued asset in the Crypto space?,"\- Earliest fork off BTC  
\- Faster transactions than BTC  
\- Lower fees than BTC  
\- Uninterrupted history - longer than BTC  
\- Deflationary, like BTC  
\- DOGE is a fork of LTC, and is merge mined (infrastructure for miners is at high scale)  
\- No founder bag (i.e. a satoshi)  
\- Proof of Work coin (more secure than proof of stake, far more capitally intensive to attack - need real hardware etc.)  
\- Distribution network, LTC is basically everywhere BTC is - even in those crypto ATMs

LTC's market cap is incredibly low at $10B as of writing this post. Simply put, that means the potential for insane growth, is high. An organization like MSTR deciding to try and do the same thing MSTR is doing with BTC, has a much higher potential upside with LTC because of its currently undervalued position.

If MSTR's strategy works, it would be silly to think someone won't replicate with LTC.

2024-12-03 00:58:06,Anyone else get scammed by Aximetria? ,"So! Aximetria, you know the Swiss Crypto exchange that was bought by a Russian investment bank? I decided to try some arbitrage trading on their platform. Their prices were way above market standards (and as the saying goes, if it’s too good to be true, it probably is).

Being a cautious guy—not particularly smart, but cautious—I started small with $100 worth of XRP. The trade went through smoothly, and my $100 turned into $105. Great! Time to repeat, right?

Here’s where the scam kicks in. My $105, now in USDT, was suddenly *flagged* as potentially funding terrorist activities. To ""verify the source"" and withdraw the funds, they asked me to deposit an additional 250 USDT into my account. Odd, but the system assured me that the funds would go straight into my wallet, and everything seemed to match up. So, despite my better judgment, I sent the 250 USDT.

I received a message stating, ""We are processing the transfer. If your funds are not released within 2 hours, contact customer support."" Two hours later, nothing. I contacted support, and guess what? They now demand 532 USDT to unlock my funds— but they did say that there is no expiration window on the transfer (so that's good, I guess).

For now, I can trade the funds within the exchange but can’t withdraw them.

**Here’s my question:**  
What’s a coin that’s likely to fail miserably—something I can buy using these trapped funds—so that at least I don’t inadvertently end up funding a warzone?

2024-12-02 14:35:49,Is 2025 the year of the DEX & DeFi?,"What would it take for you to move from using a Centralized Exchange CEX to a Decentralized Exchange DEX?

CEX's have made purchasing and hodl'ing crypto extremely easy. They have simply mirrored what we are used to, banking and brokerage websites. Easy to use with all your fiat and crypto in one place, no need to worry about backing up wallet files, keys, paper wallets etc... BTC ETF's have piled on by offering simple BTC exposure.

As we have seen over the years, there are quite a few drawbacks as well. We simply do not know what is going on behind the scenes of a CEX. Are they front running with insider accounts and manipulating the market with stable coins? Are they planning an exit scam? Will the local government simply shut them down? What if a blockchain becomes labeled a security, will it become non transferable/worthless?

DEX's on the other hand solve many trust issues however none have made it simple for the general public to utilize. Where a CEX manages all custodial aspects, a DEX requires users to learn each blockchains wallet and how to securely store each crypto. This is a never ending learning curve with how many blockchains are available and frequently updated wallets.

Being able to convert from one crypto to another quickly will become inevitable IF crypto becomes more widely accepted as a form of currency.

Even one of the oldest DEX's, BitShares, is still difficult to use with low liquidity. Other's have tried to combine the CEX with DEX by utilizing multiple internal CEX accounts and offering a external DEX style appearance, however this creates another layer of trust issues.

I got drawn by the bull hype, I randomly put a few hundred bucks on XRP because it seemed good to me after reading 15 min worth of crypto 101 articles, thinking I was dumb af to buy just after it went x2. But it actually went x2 again since then.  
I got a bit into the euphoria and put another few hundred bucks on ETH, LINK and DOGE respectively. LINK is already up 10% why 2 others are break even for now. I know it's highly volatile and the value can be halved as easily as it can be doubled and I saw most of people advising to take gains whenever possible. But admitting I know that I won't need the money anytime soon (unless I suddenly find a costly personal project worth investing in) can I just keep putting some money into diversified cryptos here and there whenever I can afford it and ignore the up and downs for a few years or is it a sure way to lose my money ?

I have been in the tech and crypto scene for a bit and found that it is difficult to track the key indicators all in one place. 

So, for fun I’ve created the following site that gauges if we are in an alt season or not using the typical indicators.

It utilizes the CoinGecko API and TradingView charts.

I wanted to share it with you all to see if you had any feedback or caught anything I had missed.

The first issue you will notice is the values on the card do not match the charts. This is because CoinGecko returns the values and TradingView does the charts. The only fix is to create my own charts but that means I need to purchase CoinGeckos Pro API which costs a lot of money lol. However, the values are off by only a few percent and should still be dependable.

Please feel free to give me feedback on the site!

2024-11-30 18:39:54,Thoughts on the cat counter part to Dogecoin? Launched days after Dogecoin in 2013. Seems like it would be a good strong historical narrative as the cat version of $DOGE? ,"I recently found the Catcoin project from my historical collectibles discord. It’s from 2013, launched days after Dogecoin and was meant to be the cat counter part to the first dog coin launched. 

Understanding that Dogecoin took off because of the memeability of DOGE, it seems like the cat version (while not as meme able), should have some for historic value? The first cat coin ever launched, the counter part to Dogecoin, all seem like strong narratives, especially in todays world of thousands of terrible meme coins being launched a day. History seems to be a constant in holding value, Dogecoin, CryptoPunks, EtherRocks, etc. 

I can’t figure out why it only has a $10M market cap? Dogecoin has a market cap of $62B. A coin as old as Dogecoin, that is the cat counter part shouldn’t least have a 1/100 value, which is a 62x. To me, it seems reasonable to have at least 1/10 the value, which is then a x620.  

Maybe there is something in the history which is why it never gained popularity? 
I bought a small amount, as a collector of historic “first” tokens. The cat version of Dogecoin with the same historic provenance seems worth a gamble to me. 

Their twitter is CatcoinOfficial.

2024-12-01 01:42:16,Lost transaction,"Good day all, 

First off very new to crypto. 

Several years ago we bought some XRP on a whim from a friend. It was located in binance apparently, not sure exactly how we got it there it was like 2018. Needless to say it just kinda sat there. 

Well with the spike my wife told me we should take a look and possibly sell them. 

Turns out several years ago binance stopped allowing folks in the US to use their accounts, we didnt know.. But hey looks like we could send our currency to another account..

So we decided to send it to a coinbase account we had, that was empty. 

Unfortunately, me being new thought to get the address i choose the company that is sending it, not the currency itself so I chose something called binanceus.  I started the transaction, but something came up and my wife finished it. Turns out we sent XRP from binance, whom had to wrap it (wrapped xrp) because it was going to a different network. 

Well Coinbase doesnt deal with wrapped xrp, and said they cannot send it back as they dont deal with this kind of currency, binance also cannot help as its out of their establishment already. 

Coinbase did say that if they eventually accept wrapped xrp it will show up in our account. 

Is there any other way to get this back or a we just screwed?

2024-11-30 20:54:20,Still think Crypto is a scam? Here's food for thought.,"To those of you who say crypto is a scam.
I want you to think back to what everyone was saying about touch screen cell phones, the internet, self driving cars, Uber just to name a few.

I had someone tell me investing in crypto is like gambling on the digital horse races. 

Everything in life is a gamble. There's no guarantee on anything except death and meeting God.

Sure prices fluctuate. Everything does. 
You fill up your gas tank just to drive, empty it then fill it back up.
You work, get money then are forced to pay bills so you go work some more and start the process all over again.

Everyone is pointing out the obvious of the prices fluctuating so much. But what do you think your bank account does? People might be broke but they're still buying Starbucks and McDonald's when they're hungry instead of investing. At least with investing you can learn to make your money work for you.

Its Absolutely no different than buying lotto or investing in traditional stock markets. And how many people still do it? Hell even in the hourse races you should still do research on the horse you're betting on. Why should it be any different when investing? Whether it's stock or crypto or anything else? 

When you buy a house, don't you go research the reality company? Don't you go find out what the neighborhood is like? Dont you request a viewing of the property?

When you buy any kind of insurance (Life, Medical, renter's, Car). Don't you compare rates?

So tell me why should it be any different when investing?
It shouldn't really matter what it is. 

You insure everything else. Why wouldn't you insure your money?

Crypto isn't just currency. It has actual use cases. These crypto companies are actually at its core just software companies

Just don't be stupid with it. If you're smart with it and learn proper risk management. Learn the cycles and how to find entry and exit points

****************
Here's a task for anyone skeptical. 

Go search up on Google what the average APY/ APR is for a credit card and a savings account.

Then go look up the numbers these crypto's are doing in a days/weeks/month's time.

Do your own research.
Then tell me I'm wrong.

I promise you I'm right

2024-11-30 06:10:52,🔥 **New to Bitcoin & Crypto? Discover Why It’s the Future and How to Invest!** 🚀🚀 🚀 ,"This thread is going to be for anyone New (and veterans) to Bitcoin and crypto who is truly interested at all about crypto and how it has a ton of value and why you should be investing.

Bitcoin and all of crypto is actually a software technology called ""blockchain""

Everything you do on the internet requires a protocol. 

Examples are Videos (Mp4 is the protocol) audio (Mp3 is the protocol)
Every link you click that directs you somewhere online is another protocol.

Bitcoin and crypto is another protocol layer ontop of everything.

Why that is important is because of the transfer of data. 
Currently we live in a 1to1 (one piece of data at a time)

Imagine I'm giving you a bottle of water. I can either hand you 1 bottle at a time. Or a whole case, or a whole pallet, or a whole truck load at a time.

That's essentially what blockchain (all of crypto) does.

The more people that are on the planet. The more data you're going to use and the faster you need that data to transfer

This is just one of the problems bitcoin and crypto solves.

To keep things simple without going crazy with too much to read for ya I'll say this

Bitcoin is like digital gold

Ethereum is like digital Oil (literally needed for every crypto transaction) 

That's just the tip of the iceberg.

There's literally 1,000's more crypto with use cases all over the board from infrastructure to banking to governments already using them including brics nation and India using xrp ripple for all oil transactions (oil is in the cars, it's cooking oil, it's used in all polyester fabrics).

Feel free to ask any questions. I'm here to help. I've been in the space for about 3 years myself and the community is tremendous and filled with a lot of really smart talented people. Let's help each other.

To find the right crypto you wanna be looking at infrastructure. For instance currently in this cycle. These are some of the top crypto to buy right now. Gaming , RWA (real world assets), Ai, Dpin.

(Everyone feel free to add your best picks with supporting reasons)

For those who are new. To start

What you do is go download 2 apps.

Coinmarketcap.com 
And
Crypto Bubbles

Use both of these with each other

Crypto bubbles gives you price analysis 
And on Coinmarketcap you can sort projects by category. 

Crypto Bubbles will show you yearly, monthly, weekly, daily and hourly.

On any one particular project
If it's more green than red across the board then it's worth looking further into. The higher percentage the better. 

When in doubt zoom out (Learn your Crypto lingo)

When you're looking for something good it's best to find something that's up for the year. Then the month and week.

Bitcoin moves 1st then Ethereum then everything else. Their will be day long periods of everything needing to catch up. Sometimes weeks or months. (Whats everyone's experience with this?)

Here's a tip. All prices will fluctuate. When bitcoin goes down and you start seeing a lot of red. Use crypto bubbles and watch what recovers on the hour and daily the fastest. This usually indicates a strong project with more potential. Making it worth looking into further.

Using coinmarketcap you can find the project's main webpage and do research on who owns the company, how strong the community is on different platforms, how many developers they have, who their partners are. Etc.

2024-11-29 20:03:55,"So let me get this straight, from a layman's understanding of crypto","Every ~4 years or so BTC experiences a halving, which after some lag time among other market factors increases the scarcity, causes its price to go up, and puts the cryptomarket in a bullrun mentality. As a result of this cyclic investment into BTC, the alts and meme coins also benefit with a new surge of capital, and it's sustained by the speculative investment that these cryptos will be institutionally adopted or gain real world utility and reflect their actual $ value in use-case one day.

Everyone is now elated because they've 100x'd their portfolios, look at all the cryptos in their wallet, still having no idea what they actually do and decide it's time to cash out. Those who timed it right make out like bandits and the majority are left holding their near worthless bags until the next cycle. The market tanks and crabs for 3 years because at some point the speculative bubble bursts when everyone wakes up and realizes there's still no real-world adoption or use-case for any of this that affects 90% of the population outside of talking about it on subreddits and niche programmers in their sandbox. 

This happens every 4 years as a self-fulfilling prophecy and I don't know whether this year to believe it will be any different or we might actually see crypto become integrated in our day-to-day and partially break free from the 3 years of crab market until the prophecy is fulfilled like the Halley's Comet hopium we've been surviving off.",115,111,Ninesect,cryptomarkets

2024-11-29 14:01:29,Thanks for the incredible advice!,"I posted earlier about investing in altcoins, and I’ve received some amazing insights from this community. I wanted to summarize the key points for anyone else who might be in a similar situation. All these gems came directly from the comments—big thanks to everyone who contributed! (Link to the original post at the end.)

Key Takeaways:

🔸 Diversification is crucial:
Spread your investments across sectors (real-world use cases, market cap, and even meme coins). But don’t overdo it—5 to 10 solid picks are better than spreading too thin.

🔸 Timing matters:
While earlier in the year might have been better, now is still a reasonable time. Always keep some cash on hand to average down if the market dips.

🔸 Look beyond hype:
Focus on altcoins with real-world utility or emerging potential. Exchange tokens and coins that haven’t peaked yet could offer great opportunities.

🔸 New vs. old projects:
Top 100 coins that are newer and haven’t been through previous bull runs may outperform older projects.

🔸 Have a strategy:
Avoid FOMO. Think long-term, consider privacy coins for uncertain times, and focus on what each project brings to the table.

3- Sell if greed reaches 94+ regardless of price (I know typically the 'peak' had less greed, but 94+ greed has always been close enough to the peak, especially between Jan-Oct after US elections.

4- Do not sell below greed 75

6- If coonbase bot reaches top 2, sell regardless of price (top 2 in top all apps in App Store)

7- If rainbow chart reaches red, sell regardless of price

8- If rainbow chart reaches orange, consider taking profit

9- Consider selling ETH when flippening index is 45+ (I know low number but not sure if ETH will perform as good as before)

10- Consider taking ETH profit when flippening index is 30+

11- Consider taking altcoin profit when index is 75+

12- Sell all altcoins when index is 90+

3. Everything other project said they would do has already been done by ICP but better

4. The most secure BTC, layer 2 scaling solution. It's got a freak BTC light node sitting In canister for God's sake.

2024-11-27 20:55:05,Tools for Managing Cryptocurrency Investments,"Сame acrossе this text about crypto tools for investment. What do you think are any of these actually effective, or is it better to just trade and hold? 🙃

*"" 1. Crypto Lending*

Crypto lending is one of the most convenient passive income instruments for digital asset owners. The essence of this method is that the user lends his crypto assets to the exchange using the chosen deposit plan. In return, he or she receives a guaranteed profit, which is accrued in the same cryptocurrency in which the deposit was opened. The terms of cryptocurrency deposits can vary significantly depending on various parameters: the minimum deposit amount, the duration of the programme, the interest rate, etc. It is similar to a traditional bank savings account, but usually with higher interest rates.

2. *Staking*

Cryptocurrency staking is a way of earning passive income, in which users block a certain amount of coins on their wallet to become eligible to participate in maintaining the blockchain. As a result, they are rewarded for helping to confirm transactions and ensure network security. At its core, staking is similar to a bank deposit, but with the potential for much higher returns, which can reach tens of percent per annum and higher. It is suitable for those who do not plan to actively trade cryptocurrencies but are going to hold tokens for a long period of time. However, not all cryptocurrencies are suitable for staking. In particular, it is available for such assets as Ethereum, Solana, Cardano, and others that use the Proof of Stake (PoS) mechanism. 

# 3. Auto-Invest Tool

Auto-invest is a tool for creating and managing an investment portfolio in cryptocurrencies. It allows you to automate the investment process by setting parameters such as portfolio amount, loan term, interest rate, etc. After setting up the auto-investment strategy, the user does not need to perform operations manually – investments are made automatically as long as there are funds on the account and the reinvestment function is activated. 

4. *Copy trading*

Copy trading is an automated strategy that allows you to copy the methods of other traders. Its essence is to follow successful traders and automatically repeat their operations on your account. Unlike traditional methods, where market analysis and the development of complex strategies play an important role, copy trading automates this process by copying the actions of other traders. This approach is perfect not only for beginners but also for professionals, helping them save time on market analysis and decision-making. 

  
5. *Auto Trading Bots*

An auto trading bot is a program that automates the process of trading cryptocurrencies on various exchanges, allowing traders to execute trades according to specified criteria without constantly monitoring the market. That is, instead of manually tracking price fluctuations, traders can set up a bot to execute trades according to certain algorithms and strategies. ""

The market is now worth a record of about $190 billion, according to crypto data provider DeFiLlama. 

Stablecoins are a kind of cryptocurrency designed to maintain a price in line with that of a fiat currency, usually the US dollar. In the past, the main use has been as a conduit for traders moving funds in and out of other tokens. But there is now mounting optimism that stablecoins may cement a more prominent role in global commerce — in particular as a tool for cross-border payments. ",7,5,PrestigiousCat969,cryptomarkets
2024-11-27 14:24:49,Bitcoin and Cardano Interoperability: Potential Impact on Cardano's Value,"A new technology, Bitcoin OS, will allow the verification of zero-knowledge proofs directly on the Bitcoin blockchain. This will allow developers to build smart contracts on Bitcoin and connect it to other blockchains, such as Cardano. Cardano is a blockchain built with a UTXO architecture like Bitcoin but has more advanced smart contract capabilities. This shared architecture will make bridging between the two chains efficient.

The use of zero-knowledge proofs means that computation can be done off-chain on Cardano, while the results are still verified on Bitcoin. This could allow Bitcoin to access decentralised finance (DeFi) applications on Cardano. Bitcoin holders will be able to use their Bitcoin to interact with DeFi applications while their assets remain secure on the Bitcoin blockchain. 

Cardano could see a significant increase in its Total Value Locked (TVL) if Bitcoin users begin to utilize its smart contract capabilities. If just 1% of Bitcoin's \$1.3 trillion market cap were to move to Cardano, it would result in a 40x increase in Cardano's TVL. This suggests that the integration of Bitcoin and Cardano has the potential to significantly increase the value of Cardano.

2024-11-27 08:54:41,What is Bitcoin Dominance and Why Does It Matter for Alt Season? 🤔,"Firstly, I want to say that many here might already be familiar with it, but I just recently came across it and finally understood it, including what is has to do with alt seaso. So, I wanted to share this for anyone who doesn't fully get it yet.

🟠 What is Bitcoin Dominance?

Bitcoin Dominance (BTC.D) refers to the percentage of the total cryptocurrency market capitalization that Bitcoin (BTC) represents. It shows how much of the total crypto market value is held in BTC compared to altcoins (everything that’s not Bitcoin).

BTC.D (%) = (BTC Market Cap / Total Crypto Market Cap) * 100

Example:
If the total crypto market cap is $1 trillion, and Bitcoin’s market cap is $500 billion, BTC dominance is 50%. This means half of the market value is in Bitcoin.

🟠 Why is BTC Dominance Important?

BTC Dominance is like a pulse check for the crypto market. It helps traders understand where the money is flowing:

High BTC Dominance: Indicates that investors prefer Bitcoin, often during uncertain or bearish markets. It suggests a risk-off environment where people see Bitcoin as the “safe” choice.

Low BTC Dominance: Means capital is moving into altcoins, which often happens during bullish phases or when investors are willing to take more risks for higher returns.

🟠 What Does This Have to Do with Alt Season?

Here’s the connection: A drop in BTC Dominance is one of the key signs of an upcoming alt season. When BTC.D falls, it means altcoins are gaining more of the market share, which usually indicates that investors are shifting their focus (and money) from Bitcoin to altcoins. This shift can lead to significant price surges across many altcoins.

In short:

Falling BTC Dominance = Altcoins outperforming BTC = Possible Alt Season.

So, next time you hear people talking about BTC Dominance, remember—it’s not just a number. It’s a powerful indicator of where the market might be headed and whether an alt season could be on the horizon.

What are your thoughts? Do you use BTC Dominance in your trading strategy?

Thoughts on the 1% Supply Given to Pavel Durov
","

I just received my **MAJOR** allocation on **Bitget**, and honestly, I’m really impressed with their efficiency! 🚀 

Now, let’s talk about MAJOR’s somewhat controversial decision: giving **1% of their total supply** to **Pavel Durov**, the founder of Telegram. It’s a bold move, clearly aimed at associating the project with a major figure in the Web3 and crypto ecosystem.

But honestly, I’m not sure it will have a significant impact. Here are a few points to consider:

1. **Pavel Durov’s actual influence:** He’s a visionary, no doubt, but he’s never publicly endorsed a specific crypto project. His role is more about building ecosystems, not promoting tokens.
2. **Telegram users and Web3:** With **900 million users**, Telegram is massive. But how many of them are genuinely interested in Web3 or crypto? The actual percentage might be much lower than we think.

That said, I can see the positive side: this kind of move can generate buzz and attract attention to MAJOR. But is it enough to truly drive the project forward in the long term?

What do you think? Is this 1% a smart strategy or just a marketing stunt with no real impact? I’d love to hear your thoughts.

2024-11-25 22:11:21,Thoughts on the KeyStone 3 Pro HW wallet?,"I'm looking to get a new hardware wallet for both BTC and alt coins. As the most popular choices, I've first looked into getting a Trezor or a Ledger, but there are things I hate about both.

Although Ledger has native support for nearly all of the alt coins I want, and seems fairly user-friendly, the fact that they're not fully open-source (AND seem to have a major f\*ck-up every few years that destroys trust even further) and invade your privacy in the Ledger Live app with trackers is pretty concerning to say the least.

And although Trezor is open source, their alt coin support sucks, native staking in the Trezor Suit is limited and they don't let you choose your preferred validator + take they a commission (even Ledger lets you choose your own validator!!!), they sometimes discontinue support for certain coins, and have a small screen size, which means that even if you're not blind signing transactions (strictly speaking), it may be harder to fully comprehend what you're signing in certain cases.

Plus, none of them are air-gapped, which isn't a ""must"", but it's definitely a ""nice-to-have"".

In an attempt to overcome the issues I have with the Trezor and the Ledger, I've started looking into other wallets – and I've come across the KeyStone 3 Pro.

At first glance, it seems like everything I'm looking for in a hardware wallet, and seems like the PERFECT wallet:

* Open source firmware
* Fully air-gapped
* Large screen and user-friendly interface
* Support for almost all coins, chains, and tokens
* It also has extra security features
* Plus, it has a pretty reasonable price (compared to competitors)

BUT after digging some more, I've come across a few potential cons:

* It's made in China, by a Chinese company (maybe not an issue on its own... then again, maybe it is?) – I'm mostly thinking it may be tampered with before shipping, it might have a built-in backdoor,  pre-loaded seeds, or maybe it's not using true randomness when generating the seeds.
* Its reviews on Amazon are... not great. Not great at all.
* I can't find information on whether they've open sourced their hardware as well (like Trezor did).
* Obviously it's newer than Trezor and has a MUCH smaller user base, so despite being open sourced, there's a higher chance of potential unnoticed errors, backdoors, and security flaws.

I guess my questions are:

1. What's the community's overall opinion of the KeyStone 3 Pro wallet?
2. Are there any pros/cons (especially cons) I'm missing?
3. How concerned should I be about the cons I've listed?
4. And does anyone have actual experience with the KeyStone 3 Pro? If so, what's your take on the wallet?",2,1,NaturalTranslator,cryptomarkets

As of November 24, 2024,  MicroStrategy’s BTC holdings amount to 386,700 coins, purchased for $21.9 billion at an average cost of \~$56,761 each, according to a post shared on X.

MicroStrategy now holds nearly 2% of Bitcoin’s total supply, with its holdings valued at over $37 billion at the time of this article.

The Block reports that Bernstein analysts anticipate MicroStrategy’s goal is to reach 4% of Bitcoin’s total supply by 2033.  This goal requires $42 billion in capital, which the company expects to secure over three years. Analysts suggest, however, that MicroStrategy could achieve this in just 18 months.

While MicroStrategy shines under Michael Saylor’s leadership, U.S. spot Bitcoin ETFs reported a staggering $3.38 billion in net inflows last week (November 18–22), as per [SoSoValue In](http://sosovalue.in/) sharp contrast, U.S. spot Ethereum ETFs faced challenges, reporting $71.6 million in net outflows during the same period.

Mercury enters its stationary phase on November 25, with retrograde motion beginning on November 26 and continuing until December 16.

2024-11-25 15:02:54,Stay away from KuCoin,"Just another of many warnings to stay away from this garbage exchange.



Judging from many others on here, and my own experience, they have essentially legalized theft of customer funds based on their own ridiculous ""policies"".



They have a minimum limit on deposits and if you miss the fine print and deposit below this limit they simply take your funds.  Even if you send another deposit to the same wallet to exceed the minimum they will refuse to give you back your first deposit.  This is literally theft.



Can you imagine depositing some money into your bank account, and the bank tells you ""sorry, that doesn't meet our minimum deposit, you need to give us more ... and by the way, we're not giving you your money back.""?  Utterly ridiculous.  How is this even legal?



KuCoin customer support is absolutely useless.  They just keep repeating the same canned responses.  It's clear they care nothing about their customers.  As soon as they get their grubby hands on your money, good luck getting it back.



And for those thinking ""you should have just sent more than the limit dude, that's their policy"", well that's besides the point.  KuCoin can't simply take customer funds with no services rendered, and say ""it's our policy"".  That is literally theft.  So they have a policy to steal customer funds whenever possible?



And if they are going to have a minimum deposit amount policy it should at least be cumulative, so that you can deposit more to get over the minimum and still get your original deposit back.  This is how other exchanges work that also have minimum deposit amounts.  But not KuCoin - they just simply confiscate your first deposit (aka theft).



I don't care too much about the amount I lost, which was minimal, but it's the whole principal of the matter and lack of customer service that really bothers me.  I simply wanted to transfer a small amount of BTC as a test transaction before sending very large amounts, to make sure I could successfully transfer to KuCoin.  Doing a test transaction on a new account is standard procedure for those trying to be safe.



What kind of company operates like this?  To prioritize stealing customer funds over customer satisfaction, and wrap it up in ""policy"".  They would prioritize stealing even a small test transaction, over keeping a customer happy.  I was going to transfer large amounts of BTC to KuCoin, and they forfeited that because they wanted to steal my small test transaction.  There's no way in hell I'll be using KuCoin now.



I guess this is a blessing in disguise.  If I had used a larger amount as my test transaction I would not have come to realize how shady and corrupt KuCoin is.  I may have risked losing much larger sums of money.  I now see many other people getting their funds confiscated by KuCoin and I sympathize with them.



Regulation is sorely needed to reign in these garbage exchanges and their poor treatment of customers.  Sure, we all hate tradfi and the banking system, but at least they aren't allowed to outright steal funds from customer accounts without rendering any services in exchange.



Sorry for the long rant, but let this serve as yet another warning to new or potential KuCoin users.

STAY AWAY FROM KUCOIN - GET YOUR FUNDS/CRYPTO OFF THAT EXCHANGE IMMEDIATELY.



You have been warned!

While the price of BGB, like any crypto asset, will ultimately be driven by the forces of demand and supply, several key factors could shape its potential growth.

First and foremost, BGB has seen consistent growth since its launch, rewarding early adopters who believed in its long-term vision. Those who got in early have enjoyed significant gains as the token has steadily increased in value. For current holders, the journey has been nothing short of rewarding—congratulations to those who’ve been part of this ride. For those not yet holding, this could be the right time to consider getting in before the next major rally. Don’t let FOMO (Fear of Missing Out) take over when you see the future potential of this token unfold!

One of the factors contributing to the success of BGB is its staking opportunities via Launchpool, where holders have been profiting by staking their tokens. This mechanism not only incentivizes users to hold their tokens but also supports the overall value of the coin.

Notably, BGB is the only major CEX token to break its all-time high during the November rally, while others like BNB (-12%), OKB (-37%), and MX (-50%) are still far from their ATH. This remarkable performance highlights the strong demand for BGB and signals that its future value could continue to rise, making it a promising asset for 2024 and beyond.

With all these factors in play, will BGB reach $5? Time will tell, but its strong momentum and the way it's seen growth potential make it one to watch closely.",0,0,Suman222000,cryptomarkets

I’m looking for an advice (not through DM).
A while ago, I was smart and got myself a cold wallet, mot very popular (SafePal), but it does the job, it also does offer SWAP option, but for Bitcoin it only offer CEX, through the Binance and some other exchange Changelly (horrible rates).
I really don’t want to use this options, as people complained in the past, that transaction is pending for quite a while and often goes through, after BTC dips, and of course transaction is on the lower value. It probably is possible to fight for a fair price, but I don’t need more stress.

I tried to ask for help few times, but obviously, got sarcy comments about how little I know etc. well yeah, I’m not an expert, but that’s the reason Reddit exists, or am I horribly wrong and Reddit is only to talk crap and bully people?

Can anyone explain, how is that, I don’t get BTC swap option on DEX? 
-Is it because my cold wallet is poor?
-Is it possible to SWAP Bitcoin, only when it’s wrapped? I guess I would have to bridge or swap my BTC into WBTC, depending what network do I have to use, and just then SWAP WBTC for USDT or something stable…?
I hold other coins, which give me a decent DEX option to SWAP, only problem is Bitcoin, strange, it meant too be main crypto coin, but it looks very limited…

I really would prefer, to try some quick safe option on DEX, before sending my BTC to crypto.com exchange and just selling it there.

2024-11-24 16:32:50,Why KNEE Coin is the Next Big Meme Coin (Because When Knee Surgery is Tomorrow... It's Time to Buy!),"Hey everyone, let’s talk about **KNEE Coin**, the Solana-based meme coin that is taking the meme world by storm. You might be wondering, ""What makes KNEE Coin so special?"" Well, let me tell you—**it’s the meme of the moment**, and if you don’t get in now, you might just miss the chance to say you were one of the OGs when knee surgery went viral.

The ""When Knee Surgery is Tomorrow"" Meme: A Quick Breakdown
For those of you who somehow haven't seen the *legendary* ""When knee surgery is tomorrow"" meme, here’s a refresher. It all started with the relatable (and a little dark) panic we all feel before any surgery. The original format reads like this:

> ""When knee surgery is tomorrow... and you still have to figure out how to explain to your friends that you're getting surgery, but not the kind of surgery they think.""

From there, it snowballed into a hilarious, absurd, and *incredibly* niche meme—because let’s face it, the internet loves two things: medical mishaps and absurd humor. And what better way to encapsulate that chaos than with a meme about knee surgery? It's *relatable* to anyone who's had a medical procedure, while also being *random enough* to make you laugh every time you see it.

### Why KNEE Coin is Perfect Timing
We’ve seen a lot of meme coins come and go, but none with the viral potential of KNEE Coin. Why? Because it's based on a meme that *everyone can relate to*—whether you’ve had a knee injury, known someone who has, or just like laughing at people being in pain (don’t lie, it’s funny sometimes).

Here’s the kicker: **KNEE Coin is a Solana-based token**, which means it’s fast, cheap, and scalable—perfect for making meme coin transactions that much more *meme-tastic*. You can send KNEE across the blockchain with almost no fees and no delays—talk about smooth, just like the recovery after knee surgery (hopefully).

### Funny Facts About KNEE Coin That'll Make You Want to Buy:
1. **Solana Speed**: Just like the memes surrounding knee surgery, KNEE Coin makes its moves fast. Forget about waiting for your transaction to go through—it’s on-chain before you can even say ""knee brace.""
  
2. **Low Fees**: Why pay high fees when you’re just trying to make a funny meme-related purchase? With KNEE Coin, you’re getting all the meme with none of the costs.

3. **It’s *Literally* the Internet's Funniest Injury**: Sure, knee surgery might not be as glamorous as some other injuries, but there’s something oddly hilarious about the thought of someone going under the knife for *something so trivial* (no offense to actual knee surgery patients—just imagine explaining it at a party).

4. **KNEE Surgery = Major Life Decision**: The meme captures that hilarious, absurd moment in life when something as mundane as knee surgery becomes a *giant* ordeal. And buying KNEE Coin is kind of the same way—it’s not just about the meme, it’s about embracing a big decision in the wild world of crypto.

### Conclusion: Why KNEE Coin is the Future
When people look back at meme coins, they’ll remember Dogecoin, Shiba Inu, and of course... **KNEE Coin**. It's a perfect storm of niche humor, relatability, and blockchain speed. So, if you want to get in on a coin that could have you *laughing* all the way to the moon, hop on KNEE Coin today!

Don't let FOMO hit you when knee surgery is tomorrow—buy KNEE Coin today and get ahead of the meme game. 🦵

**TL;DR**: KNEE Coin = Solana-based meme coin. Knee surgery meme = hilarious, relatable, and about to explode. Get in early, because this coin’s moving faster than a knee recovering from surgery.

**Example: Solana (SOL)**, without combining them into a single position. 

* Open one long position on SOL at **3x leverage**, set with a long-term liquidation price.
* Open another long position on SOL at **10x leverage**, designed for a quick flip.
* Keep these positions completely independent, each with its own margin, leverage, and liquidation levels, without the exchange merging them into a single position.

On platforms like MEXC, all positions on the same crypto (e.g., SOL) are combined into one, making it impossible to manage them separately. This doesn’t work for my strategy since I trade using varying leverage and margin for different timeframes and risk levels.

Of course, most ATH have not been reached yet, but price is rising for almost every altcoin.

So why is it not considered a bullrun yet ? Is « bullrun » a specific term that means that things will go even crazier, with ATH reached very quickly ?

Portfolios currently at ~65% ETH 30%LINK split.
I'm wondering whether I should convert all my ETH to Link to maximise the dollar value in the bull run

do you buy crypto during a bull run or should you wait till the bull run is over, if it ever ends. I have some FOMO, that's why I'm wondering if I should buy more while its still justifiable.
